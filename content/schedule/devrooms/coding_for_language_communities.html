Free software is a requirement for free communication in any language.
Our goal is to empower language communities to build their own tools
based on free software projects. We focus on of lesser-resourced
languages, but also like to promote multi-lingualism in software
projects in general. We want to give people the ability to use their
mother tongue in everyday electronic communication, no matter where they
are or what language they speak.
