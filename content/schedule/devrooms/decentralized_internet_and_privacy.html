Free Software initial promises were to empower individuals when it came
to computing. Three decades later, computing practices are tightly
coupled to the Internet ecosystem. PCs are less and less used while
smartphones are soaring and data is collected and stored on servers on
which we have very limited control as users. What happened to user's
freedom and privacy in the meantime? The outlook is not so great: we
have less and less control over our digital environment. Network
neutrality is heavily attacked and mainstream software products are
usually proprietary or run on servers we don't have control over.
Modern technology has given the powerful new abilities to eavesdrop and
collect data on people - with critical social and political
consequences.

Developers play a crucial role in the making of decentralized systems
and software designed to preserve the privacy of everyone. Speakers will
present the technical projects they are involved in. It will be an
opportunity to learn about the latest news and be inspired to join them.
