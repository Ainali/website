Python is an interpreted, high-level, general-purpose programming language.
It features a dynamic type system and automatic memory management. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including object-oriented, imperative, functional and procedural, and has a large and comprehensive standard library.

<p>
One of the great strengths of the Python community, is that it was it with a "open by default" culture. The packaging system is built around open standards, about everything the community does is open-sourced. Even if there are many successful businesses built on Python, most companies still contribute back their code, because that's what we always do.

<p>
Since the code and the tools are free and easy to learn, it has become a first computer language in several universities around the world. The community is built on very positive values such as sharing knowledge, education and diversity.
