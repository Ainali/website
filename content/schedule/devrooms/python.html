<p>
  Python is a widely used general-purpose, high-level programming language.
  Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability, and its syntax allows
  programmers to express concepts in fewer lines of code than would be
  possible in languages. The language provides constructs intended to enable
  clear programs on both a small and large scale.
