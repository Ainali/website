As we all assemble more complex software apps from an ever growing number of free and open source software components, knowing what's in our code is a must for legal, security and operational reasons. Software Composition Analysis (SCA) is the set of techniques to determine which software components we reuse, where and how, as well as their origin, licensing, vulnerabilities, quality and other important attributes.
Open source SCA tools are emerging as the best way to help determine which FOSS software components are used in a software system or application.

You are an SCA FOSS tool or project contributor, maintainer, or user? If so, let's meet at FOSDEM 2021 to share our techniques, experiences and bag of tricks and demo or present our FOSS tools to colloborate towards a better SCA FOSS toolchain.
