  Wikis are essential tools for online collaboration, open knowledge and free
  software. They are everywhere: from the mainstream Wikipedia to a myriad of
  public, academic and corporate knowledge bases and personal sites. And most of
  them are open source software.

  Wikis developer room is a place to showcase and discuss

  <ul>
    <li>new features, especially exploring areas beyond plain text editing</li>
    <li>compatibility and integration with other tools and services</li>
    <li>lessons learned from deployments, surveys, research...</li>
    <li>cross-project collaboration</li>
  </ul>
</p>

  We want to focus on sessions for a technical audience including savvy editors.
