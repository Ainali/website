Ada is a general-purpose programming language originally designed
for safety- and mission-critical software engineering.  It is used
extensively in air traffic control, rail transportation, aerospace,
nuclear, financial services, medical devices, etc.  It is also
perfectly suited for open source development.

Awareness of safety and security issues in software systems is
increasing.  Multi-core platforms are now abundant.  These are
some of the reasons that the Ada programming language and technology
attracts more and more attention, among others due to Ada's support for
programming by contract and for multi-core targets.  The latest Ada
language definition was updated early 2016.  Work on new features is
ongoing, such as improved support for fine-grained parallelism, and
will result in a new Ada standard scheduled for 2020.  Ada-related
technology such as SPARK provides a solution for the safety and
security aspects stated above.

More and more tools are available, many are open source, including
for small and recent platforms.  Interest in Ada keeps increasing,
also in the open source community, and many exciting projects have
been started.

The Ada DevRoom aims to present the facilities offered by the
Ada language (such as for object-oriented, multicore, or embedded
programming) as well as some of the many exciting tools and projects
using Ada.
