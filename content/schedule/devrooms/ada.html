Ada is a general-purpose programming language originally designed
for safety- and mission-critical software engineering.  It is used
extensively in air traffic control, rail transportation, aerospace,
nuclear, financial services, medical devices, etc.  It is also
perfectly suited for open source development.

Awareness of safety and security issues in software systems is
increasing.  Multi-core platforms are now abundant.  These are some
of the reasons that the Ada programming language and technology
attracts more and more attention, among others due to Ada's support
for programming by contract and for multi-core targets.
The Ada 2012 language definition was approved and published by ISO in
December 2012, updated early 2016, and work on new features for the
next revision is ongoing.  As with the prior Ada 1995 and Ada 2005
standards, the first full implementation of the Ada 2012 standard
was made available in gcc - the GNU Compiler Collection (GNAT).
More and more tools are available, many are open source, including
for small and recent platforms.  Interest keeps increasing, also in
the open source community, and many exciting projects started.

The Ada DevRoom aims to present the facilities offered by the
Ada language (such as for object-oriented, multicore, or embedded
programming) as well as some of the many exciting tools and projects
using Ada.
