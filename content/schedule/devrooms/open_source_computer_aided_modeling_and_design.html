Open source computer aided modeling and design is rapidly maturing into 
a solution of choice for hardware designers.  The developer room focuses on the 
creation of free, open-source software that supports designers from concept 
to creation of physical objects.  We will create a space for software and 
hardware hackers to come together to develop the inter-project collaborations 
that make FOSS a compelling choice for everyone from makers to professional 
hardware design firms.
