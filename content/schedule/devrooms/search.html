Full-text search is everywhere and it is also back at FOSDEM this year.
</p>
<p>The more data and interconnected systems you have, the more you need powerful search systems. And while databases commonly get a lot of attentions, search engines are often underrepresented. This room gives full-text search the spotlight it deserves. Luckily there are plenty of open source implementations in this area and possible topics include:
<ul>
<li>What is the state of full-text search in relational databases such as PostgreSQL or MySQL?</li>
<li>How are search libraries like Apache Lucene evolving?</li>
<li>What are current improvements and issues in popular search engines such as Elasticsearch and Solr?</li>
<li>What is the role of machine learning in search and how do you even measure search quality?</li>
<li>Which new systems are entering the search market?</li>
<li>What is the place of client-side search tools like Fuse.js, Js Search, Lunr, and Elasticlunr.js or are they just toys?</li>
<li>Are there any new break throughs or is BM25 good (enough)?</li>
</ul>
