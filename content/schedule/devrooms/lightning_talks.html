  Lightning talks are short and focused talks on a wide variety of open source
  topics.
</p>

<p>
  The goal is to showcase projects which do not fit in a specific main track or
  developer room.  Speakers get exactly fifteen minutes to present their project
  or any aspect of it.

  All lightning talks are scheduled in a large auditorium seating approximately
  300 people.
