<p>
  Perl is an open source programming language with over 26 years of
  development. Perl is used all over the world for virtually all
  purposes, ranging from small sysadmin jobs and rapid prototyping to
  large scale development projects.  Our motto is "There is more than
  one way to do it" and Perl offers all the flexibility to get the job
  done.

<p>
  The Perl-community is tremendously active with over 250 Perl user
  groups (so-called "Perl Mongers") worldwide.  Most Perl Monger groups
  have regular, monthly, meetings.  The Amsterdam Perl Mongers meet
  every 1st Tuesday for dinner and technical presentations.  The
  Niederrhein Perl Mongers meet on the 3rd Tuesday, the Brussels Perl
  Mongers on the 2nd Tuesday.
