<p>High Performance Computing (HPC) and Big Data are two important
approaches to scientific computing. HPC typically deals with smaller,
highly structured data sets and huge amounts of computation while Big
Data, not surprisingly, deals with gigantic, unstructured data sets and
focuses on the I/O bottlenecks. With the Big Data trend unlocking access
to an unprecedented amount of data, Data Science has emerged to tackle
the problem of creating processes and approaches to extracting knowledge
or insights from these data sets. Machine learning and predictive
analytics algorithms have joined the family of more traditional HPC
algorithms and are pushing the requirements of cluster and data
scalability.</p>

<p>Free and Open Source communities have been the foundation of the HPC
and Big Data communities for some time. In the HPC community, it should
be no surprise that 488 of the Top500 supercomputers in the world run
Linux. On the Big Data side, the Hadoop ecosystem has had a tremendous
amount of Open Source contributions from a wide range of organizations
coming together under the Apache Software Foundation.</p>

<p>Our goal is to bring the communities together, share expertise, learn
how we can benefit from each other's work and foster further joint
research and collaboration. We welcome talks about Free and Open Source
solutions to the challenges presented by large scale computing, data
management and data analysis.</p>
