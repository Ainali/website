The Open Source Design devroom showcases design work happening within
free and open source projects, because yes, there is design live in
FOSS. We mean &quot;design&quot; in a broad sense, and we include within
that term typography, graphic design, interaction design, user
experience, human-computer interaction, accessibility, information
architecture, content strategy, service design, design research and
&lt;add your favourite buzzword here&gt;. We hope to see you there.
