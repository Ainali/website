Software developers have a much easier time sharing their developments
than hardware designers. When you put a piece of code on the Web, you
don't ask yourself if others will have the freedom and resources to
access a text editor to look at it and modify it, or a compiler or
interpreter to have the code do something useful. The landscape for
hardware designs is more complicated. The dominant design and simulation
tools are proprietary, and there is not even a de-facto proprietary
standard format to share designs. The Electronic Design Automation (EDA)
devroom looks at recent progress in Free tools for hardware design and
simulation, and serves as a meeting place for discussion about future
collaborations and developments. Come and see how some of these tools
are actually catching up, and sometimes even more, in terms of features
and quality.
