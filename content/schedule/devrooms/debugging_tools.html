<p>
The Debugging Tools devroom features session topics describing various
debugging and tracing tools, both for userspace and kernelspace.

<p>
Devrooms are a place for development teams to meet, discuss, hack and
publicly present the project's latest improvements and future directions.

We will have a whole day to hang out together as community
embracing debugging and tracing tools.
Please join us, regardless of whether you are a core hacker,
a plugin hacker, a user, a packager or a hacker on a
project that integrates, extends or complements debugging tools.
