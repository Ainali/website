RISC-V (pronounced "RISC-five") is an open CPU instruction set
architecture whose specification is available under the CC-BY
license.  During the last years, the RISC-V ecosystem has grown
tremendously and upstream support for the architecture has been
included in significant parts of the free-software landscape
(e.g. in binutils, gcc, glibc, qemu and Linux).  Multiple Linux
distributions are working on ports to the RISC-V architecture
and the first commercially available linux-capable RISC-V silicon
has been presented at FOSDEM 2018.

The FOSDEM RISC-V devroom covers the current developments in
open-source soft- and hardware for the RISC-V architecture.
