Join us for a full day of Linux containers, microservice orchestation,
Docker, Kubernetes, DCSes, and more.  This day covers everything about
new containerized application stacks, from the practical to the
theoretical, including both workshop material and cutting-edge ideas
about how services and applications should be defined and isolated.
Whether you're an infrastructure hacker, or a devops admin, we'll have
something for you.
