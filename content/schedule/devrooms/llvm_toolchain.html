LLVM is a compilation infrastructure being used in production by a
wide variety of commercial and open source projects as well as being
widely used in academic research. In addition, its components form an
open source toolchain that is already the system default on Android,
FreeBSD and some Linux distributions. LLVM hardware support ranges
from the most embedded platforms to large HPC clusters, with a vibrant
community engaged on improving all sides of the toolchain.
