This devroom is devoted to the emerging open-source ecosystem around Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) which make use of modern hardware extensions like Intel SGX, ARM TrustZone, AMD SEV/SME and others. With today's mainstream consumer hardware being increasingly shipped with these advanced trusted computing technologies, the devroom wants to foster discussion on the much-needed open-source TEE ecosystem amongst open-source hobbyists, academics, enthusiasts, and project maintainers. The devroomâ€™s topics of interest include, but are not limited to:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Programming frameworks for TEEs (how best to program and use TEEs)</li>
  <li>System support for TEEs (effective interaction of untrusted software with TEEs and vice-versa )</li>
  <li>Use cases and applications on top of TEEs</li>
  <li> TEE-specific attacks and defenses (side-channels, vulnerabilities, exploits)</li>
  <li> Open-source TEE architecture designs</li>
  <li> Vision: Future TEEs (what is missed, proposals, wishes, discussions)</li>
</ul>
