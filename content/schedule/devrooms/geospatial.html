The Geospatial devroom is the place to talk about the state of the art
of open, geo-related data, free and open source geospatial software
and its ecosystem. This includes standards and tools, e.g. spatial
databases, online mapping tools, geospatial services, used for
collecting, storing, delivering, analysing, and visualizing geodata.
