OpenPOWER is an open hardware and software platform architecture.
During the last years, the POWER ecosystem has opened up.
The CPU instruction set (ISA), CPU cores, the system specifications, the firmware,
the system design and much more is open.
The OpenPOWER ecosystem is build on the existing POWER ecosystem,
and is now fully open (e.g. in binutils, gcc, glibc, qemu and Linux).
Multiple Linux distributions have working ports to the OpenPOWER architecture
and the silicon process is becoming also open.
