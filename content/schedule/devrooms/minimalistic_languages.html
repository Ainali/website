Minimalism matters. Minimalism allows for smaller systems that take
less resources and consume less energy. More importantly, free and
open source minimalism allows for secure systems that are easy to
understand. Finally, we believe that minimalism is educational and
brings back the fun of the early days of computing where people learn
to understand systems from the ground up. Speakers will be asked to
accentuate the educational side of their projects.
