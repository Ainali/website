As more and more workloads are being considered for containerization
in the future and are finally landing in virtualized environments today,
distributions remain a critical success factor and are more important
than ever. Containers, like virtual machines, are not magical and
rely on piles of software being assembled in a way that is repeatable,
reliable, and functional. This is at the very heart of the problem that
distributions have always solved.

Each distribution is responsible for building, testing, and releasing
software as well as managing the lifecycle of each application in the
collection. Additionally, distributions do very important work in ensuring
that various versions of upstream software work well together and can
co-exist. Distributions are also, often responsible, for "de-vendoring"
upstream software so that security fixes can be applied more quickly.

For this year's distributions devroom, we want to focus on the ways that
distribution technologies can be leveraged to allow for easier
creation of a multi-verse of artifacts from single source trees. We also
want to continue to highlight the huge efforts being made in shared
environments around Build/Test/Release cycles. Hot topics related to
the delivery problem as it impacts updates in terms of both size and
rollback/reliability are expected to be featured.
