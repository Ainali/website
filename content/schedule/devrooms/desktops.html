The Desktops DevRoom is a unique opportunity to show novel ideas and
developments related to desktop computing to a wide technical audience.

<p>
We invite developers and systems administrators to present their talks
about Free/Libre/Open-source Software on the topics of Desktop
development, Desktop applications and interoperability amongst Desktop
Environments. Topics accepted include, but are not limited to:
Enlightenment, Gnome, KDE, Unity, LxQt/XFCE/Razor, CDE, Windows, Mac OS
X, general desktop matters, applications that enhance desktops,
development tools and web (when related to desktop).
</p>

<p>
The developer room organisation is taken care of by a team that
represents the major open source desktops (Gnome, KDE, Enlightenment,
Unity and LxQt).
