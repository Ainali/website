  The Internet of Things devroom will cover topics such as:
  machine-to-machine communication on small embedded devices,
  distributed applications for autonomous/self-controlled devices,
  discovery and infrastructure, and interoperability. Most talks will
  consist of a demo followed by explanations and discussion. There is a
  two-hour slot in the afternoon for participant-driven talks and
  further demos.
