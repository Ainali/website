<p>The <a href="http://fosdem.rubybelgium.be/">Ruby devroom</a> is a focused
developer room around the Ruby programming language and the open source
projects which implement it. While the Ruby community does have a number of
regional conferences devoted to its use, opportunities for those interested in
the &quot;how it works&quot; of Ruby interpreters and virtual machines are
practically non-existent. The goal of this developer room is to discuss:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The current state of the Ruby language</li>
  <li>Techniques employed by various VMs and their effectiveness</li>
  <li>Upcoming Ruby language features, and the challenges/benefits that
they provide</li>
  <li>Tools and practices used to certify Ruby language conformity and
performance</li>
  <li>Costs and Opportunities provided by the multitude of
implementations</li>
</ul>
