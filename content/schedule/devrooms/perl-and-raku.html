<p>Perl and Raku are sister languages created originally by Larry Wall. While Perl is the tried-and-true workhorse of the Internet, Raku has been designed as the multi-paradigm language for the next hundred years</p>

<p>The Perl&Raku devroom is open to all developers and users, as well as to tangential topics that could use any of them. If you've got anything to say, and have said it with Perl or Raku, you'll be very welcome.</p>
