This devroom is all about all open source games. Although closed source
is still the norm in the gaming industry, there is a growing number of
independent games that are being released as open source. In addition,
there are a number of open source projects that help in game
development, including game engines, assets, and hardware. Finally,
there are citizen science games in which players produce open data that
are used to advance science.

This devroom will have talks about open source games, open game tools,
open game hardware, and open data.

In addition there will be a one-hour demo session in the middle of the
day. Come by and play!
