The security devroom topic this year is <q>Security and Privacy in
Modern Software</q>.
</p>

<p>
Cryptography has been the foundation of modern crypto software,
however, it is only a small fraction of the technology required to
achieve security and privacy for users. Thus this year's topic is to
focus on the other parts that make software secure: usability, the
protection against side-channels, message length analysis,
fingerprinting, secure coding practices, code review processes etc. We
welcome presentations of security software and hardware which take
into account these factors, and presentations that analyze other's
solutions.
