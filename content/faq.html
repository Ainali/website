        <h5><span class="label label-info">Q:</span> I need a formal invitation for a VISA request</h5>
        <p>For legal reasons, the FOSDEM organization can only issue such letters of invitation to “main track” speakers for whom we also make travel and hotel arrangements.</p>

        <p>If you are attending FOSDEM as part of your involvement with a project represented at our conference, we recommend you get in touch with someone you know locally who is involved in the project and ask them to invite you.</p>
