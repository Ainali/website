        <h5><span class="label label-info">Q:</span> Where can I find the T-shirts and hoodies?</h5>
        <p>
            There are two places where you can find T-shirts, depending on whether you are in the EU or not.
        </p>
        <p>
            Visitors from the EU go to <a href="https://treasure.fosdem.org">treasure.fosdem.org</a>, which ships
            to the EU.
        </p>
        <p>
            Visitors from the rest of the world go to <a href="https://row.treasure.fosdem.org">row.treasure.fosdem.org</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you can't find your country in either of the shops, send an e-mail to <i>treasure-at-fosdem-dot-org</i> with
            how much hoodies/T-shirts you wish to order.
