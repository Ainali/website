    Online stands may seem a bit different from physical stands, but not a lot has changed. We have a little over 50 stands, organised per <a href="https://stands.fosdem.org/themes/">theme</a>.
    Normally, we would also split them per building, but this year we decided not to do so ;-)
</p>
<p>
    Each stand has its own page (or group of pages), with all the information and topics they wish to show you. We've also created a special chat room for each stand, where you can discuss with the team behind the project (a bit like the hallways - though less crowded). Some stands also recorded video's, demoing their product or showing their <i>new hot thing</i>.

<p>
    You can browse the stands per theme <a href="https://stands.fosdem.org/themes/">here</a> (or below) or visit all the stands <a href="https://stands.fosdem.org/stands/">here</a>.
