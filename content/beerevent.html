<p>
While coming over to Brussels to attend FOSDEM, don’t miss this great
opportunity to taste some of the finest
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgian_beer">beer in Belgium</a>
(and hence in the world).
</p>

<h2>When?</h2>

<p>
  <span title="<%= (days.first[:conference_day] - 1).strftime("%Y-%m-%d") %>"
    class="dtstart">
    <%= (days.first[:conference_day] - 1).strftime("%A, %e %B %Y") %>
  </span>
  from 16h00 onwards, but feel free to join the party at any time of the
  evening.
</p>
<p>
  We will be there until the bar closes (well after midnight).
</p>

<h2>Beer, Beer and some more Beer</h2>
<p>
  The Beer Event will again take place at the
  <a href="http://www.deliriumcafe.be/">Delirium Caf&eacute;</a>,
  in a beautiful alley near the
  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Place">Grand Place</a>
  in Brussels.
</p>

<p>
  For efficiency reasons, the number of different beers is limited.
</p>

<h2>Virtual Beer Distribution Algorithm v3.3.99.beta</h2>

<p>
  After about twenty years of incremental improvements to our notorious Beer
  Distribution Algorithm, we appear to have almost reached a stable version with the
  algorithm used: v3.3.99.beta
  We have some small changes to the algorithm to announce this year.
</p>

<h2>Security measures / access control</h2>
<p>
  We have reserved the ground floor of the bar (<em>Delirium Caf&eacute;</em>)
  as a private party for FOSDEM, and this between 18h00 and 1h00. You are welcome to
  join as of 16h00, as well as stay after 1h00.  FOSDEM volunteers will help us keep 
  this area FOSDEM-only. If you meet a volunteer or a guard at the entrance to the bar or
  at the entrace to the alley, make it clear that you are there for the
  FOSDEM party. Wearing appropriately geeky attire tends to do the trick, as does 
  demonstrating your initiation into geekdom has been successful. If your attempt fails,
  you'll get a second chance: your answers to some very tricky questions will determine
  how you'll spend your Friday evening.
</p>

<h2>Beer Tokens</h2>
<p>
  Tokens pricing starts at &euro;5.00 for one token, and decreases to &euro;3.60 if bought
  in sufficient quantities.
  One token, one glass (25cl) of draught beer (<em>draft</em> for our intercontinental
  visitors).
  For the sake of simplicity, <em>soda</em> (cola, lemonade, water, etc) is beer
  too&mdash;at least as far as tokens are concerned.
  Tokens may be bought individually or in bigger quantities, but FOSDEM staff 
  prefers to deal with bigger quantities and paper money rather than metal money. 
  It’s lighter, easier to sort and recycles perfectly. No electronic payments
  are supported, please ensure you have cash money (in euros) if you plan to
  quench that thirst!
  Tokens will be sold as of 18h00 (at the same time when our reserved space becomes
  exclusive for FOSDEM visitors).
  FOSDEM tokens are also accepted at the <em>Hoppy Loft</em> (first floor), 
  the <em>Floris Bar</em>&mdash;consisting of
  the <em>Tequileria</em>, the <em>Garden</em> and the <em>Monasterium</em>&mdash;
  (across the alley from the <em>Delirium Caf&eacute;</em>)
  as well as at the bar in the basement (<em>Taphouse</em>).
</p>

<p>
  When you arrive at the bar, find the token selling booth (look for arrows, 
  as well as a gaggle of geeks in flashy yellow and orange t-shirts).
  In exchange for <em>cash</em> money, you will receive “beer tokens”.
</p>

<p>
  We know you'd like to be able to use your bank card for payments. Unfortunately
  we can not comply with that request. Mobile connectivity is a tricky thing,
  given the location and the amount of radiation a crowd will absorb. As such, we require euro
  bills and/or coins. We advise you acquire the appropriate amounts of cash beforehand.
  We can point out the following ATM's in the neighbourhood:

<h2>Quality of Service</h2>
<p>
  To keep latencies low and throughput high, we need everyone’s help.
  The easiest way to keep things going smoothly is for everyone to work together
  and implement a properly coded transmit and receive window, as well as 
  implement multiplexing and virtualisation.
  Send out one person at a time to acquire resources for your group. There's no
  reason why each member of your group should go and get tokens. It's a double
  win: less people in the queue, and more tokens for the same amount (1 token 
  costs more per token than 10).
  Do not order individual beers&mdash;order beers for people around you too!
  Trays will be made available to efficiently move more than one beer from the
  bar to where they are needed.
  Similarly, when ordering beer, please take a moment to collect any empty
  glasses around you on a tray and send them back to the bar with whoever is
  ordering beer.
</p>

<p>
  The Delirium Caf&eacute; staff is working hard to make our evening as pleasant
  as possible, but we’re legion.
</p>

<h2>Laws of Physics</h2>
<p>
  Sadly, even the FOSDEM Beer Event is subject to the fundamental laws of
  physics.
  Our request for an exception for the principle that no two solid objects
  can occupy the same space at the same time resulted in an <code>RSET</code>.
  If you find the bar getting too crowded, it might help to go for dinner and
  come back later.
  Some of the bars will be open until 06:00 (that’s 6am to intercontinental geeks).
  While FOSDEM staff will stop distributing tokens a couple of hours before closure
  (we have a conference to set up early in the morning), the tokens will be valid
  all night and after tokens run out, beer can be exchanged directly for cash
  too.
  From past experience the bar service has a very high packet loss&mdash;as well as
  a high number of collisions and retries&mdash;between 22:30 and 00:45.
</p>

<h2>A note of caution</h2>
<p>
  Unlike some other beers, Belgian beer is not just coloured water.
  Some beers contain significant quantities of alcohol and <em>will</em> give
  you a pounding hangover (as a side note, consuming lots of (pure) water helps
  preventing that, and Club Mate can get you back into shape the next day,
  the bar at FOSDEM has this nectar available on Saturday and Sunday).
  FOSDEM staff is not responsible for any hallucinations you may experience as a
  result of this event. <code>:-)</code>
</p>

<h2>Be there!</h2>
<p>
  A lot of work has gone into making this beer event the best ever.
  We’ve taken into account the suggestions from previous years and are confident
  that this edition will be a blast.
  Bring your friends and join us for a great evening out as well as a great
  opportunity to socialise with fellow contributors from all around the world.
