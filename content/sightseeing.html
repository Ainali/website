<p>
  Starting in 2009, FOSDEM has hired professional guides each year to offer free
  guided tours of Brussels to the spouses/partners of FOSDEM visitors.
  If your partner would like to accompany you to Brussels but is not interested
  in the FOSDEM conference, this will make their stay worthwhile.
  Brussels has a rich historical past and a cosmopolitan present.
</p>

<p>
  The <em>free tours</em> will take place on both days during the conference.
  Each tour will give you a view of a different side of the city, and the tours
  offered this year will be different from those offered in previous years.
</p>
  
<p>
  The meeting point is next to the infodesk in front of the H building, and the tours end here as well.
  For both tours, Saturday and Sunday you have to register in front providing phonenumber and e-mail.
  Send an e-mail to Tours@FOSDEM.org providing name, e-mail and phonenumber and await a confirmation.
  We need this information for emergencies and won't use it or store it for any other purpose.
  It will be deleted after Fosdem ends.
</p>

<p> 
  Come to H-Building ON TIME. If you are to late we sadly can't wait for you!
  We gather in front of H-building next to the infodesk from 13:30 for both tours.
  We leave no later then 13:45 to the Busstop which will take you all to the city centre. (Carréfour de l'Europe)
</p>

<P>
  From there the tourguide (Saturday: Adeline / Sunday: Adrian) will take you on a discovery tour through Brussels.
</p>

<p>
  <b>The Saturday tour</b> will be the popular tour of the beautifull city centre of Brussels.
  The guide will show you the main sights of Brussels. By foot, we will introduce you to the most important monuments 
  and we will give you a great overview of the city in just 3 hours, including:

<p>
  <b>The Sunday tour</b> starts at the same time as Saturday and will end at 17:00 after which we will travel back to the ULB.
  Here we will arrive approximately around 17:40.
  This is called the alternative tour which means we will show you Brussels from another side.
