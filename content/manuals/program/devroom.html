<h2>Devroom expectations</h2>

<p>
The demand for devrooms far exceeds the supply so we do not want rooms to be planned to be empty during the event. By applying for a devroom you are making a commitment to fill the schedule.
</p>
<p>
Devroom coordinators must enter a complete schedule into our conference system by 15th December. It is particularly important to be available and to respond promptly to emails about the schedule for about a week either side of this date.
<ul>
   <li>Saturday devroom schedules should contain between 7.5 and 8.5 hours of content, beginning at 10.30 and running until between 18.00 and 19.00.</li>
    <li>Sunday schedules should contain between 7 and 8 hours of content and start between 09.00 and 10.00 and run through until 17.00.</li>
    <li>No lunch breaks should be scheduled. </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
If you don't think you can fill a full day, please try to join up with another project and submit a joint devroom application or indicate on this submission form that you are requesting only half-a-day and would like FOSDEM to try to pair you up with another similar request for half-a-day.
</p>
<p>
Because our room capacity is limited, we will record and stream all devrooms live. The recordings will be published under the same licence as all FOSDEM content (CC-BY). If, exceptionally, there is a reason why any particular speaker or discussion should not be streamed or recorded, you must seek our agreement before including this in your schedule as such permission is unlikely to be granted.
</p>
<p>
You also agree to find:
<ul>
    <li>one (or more) volunteers to take responsibility for the devroom at times you are not present, such as when you go for lunch;</li>
    <li>one (or more) volunteers to manage the microphone handover and camera through the day. Full instructions will be supplied. </li>
</ul>
</p>

<h2>Before the event</h2>
<h3>Call for Papers</h3>
<p>
Devrooms normally issue a Call for Papers.
<ul>
    <li>Note the deadline: 15/10</li>
    <li>Send a copy to the <a href="https://lists.fosdem.org/listinfo/fosdem"> FOSDEM mailing list </a>.</li> 
    <li>We'll put a link to this on our website news article.
              Here is the current one: <a href="https://archive.fosdem.org/2020/news/2018-10-01-accepted-developer-rooms/">https://archive.fosdem.org/2020/news/2018-10-01-accepted-developer-rooms/</a></li>
    <li>Browse examples from previous years if you need inspiration. If you wish, you can ask for review before publication on this list or on devrooms at fosdem.org.</li>
</ul>
<p>
We can also make adjustments to the names of devrooms at this early
stage - particularly if related proposals got combined or you want
to emphasise some little change of focus.
</p>
<p>
Full details of all talks and speakers that you schedule must be
submitted into our 'pentabarf' database which is used to generate our
website no later then <b>15th December</b>.  Please try to complete this 
earlier. It is better to find out scheduling conflicts early, and by the end of december it is hard to reach people. The schedule at the 1st of January is used for the booklet.
</p>
<p>
<p>
The half-day rooms should divide the available time by two and allow a
gap of about 30 minutes in the middle for switchover.
</p>
<p>
IMPORTANT - Nothing should be scheduled outside these hours:
  Saturday 10.30-19.00
    Sunday   09.00-17.00
    Every year some devroom schedules ignore this and have to get fixed!
</p>
<p>
    To avoid entering everything yourself, ask people to propose talks
    through
      https://penta.fosdem.org/submission/FOSDEM20
      reminding them that if they already have an account from a previous year
      they should reuse it.  (Our website links speakers to all their talks
      across all the years of FOSDEM.)  Then you can use the system to review
      and select talks, and transfer them between devrooms if appropriate.
</p>
<h3 id="review">Reviewing talks</h3>
<div>
   <a href="https://penta.fosdem.org/report/review/">https://penta.fosdem.org/report/review/
</a>
</div> 
<p>
Use this to view and review proposals assigned to your devroom track.
You can add ratings and remarks in the <b>Rating</b> tab. These will not be accessible to the speaker.
</p>
<p>
Use these fields for your workflow:
<ul>
   <li>Event state</li>
   <li>Progress</li>
   <li>Notes</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
    Ultimately, all 'events' in your devroom track either need to be rejected, or accepted and (re)confirmed. Obviously, don't change the state of events in other tracks.
</p>
<p>
   
</p>
<p>If there are any talks proposed for your devroom which seem attractive for a very large audience, consider asking to program@ if they could be included in main.</p>
<p>
Please don't change the tracks assigned to any Main Track / Keynote /
Lightning Talks at this stage as we have not reviewed them yet and it's
only fair that we consider them under the track that the submitter
selected before considering transferring them to a different track.</p>
<p>
(And we won't object if any of you help us out by adding your own review
comments or scores to events in these tracks as long as you are being
reasonably objective and not just giving your friends' talks top scores!)
</p>

<h3 id="scheduling">Scheduling talks</h3>
<div class="alert-info">
<p><b>When scheduling tasks in pentabarf: please stick to these rules:</b></p>
<ul>
    <li>Saturday devroom schedules should contain between 7.5 and 8.5 hours
    of content, beginning at 10.30 and running until between 18.00 and
    19.00.<br>
    Split devrooms have to make sure there is a break between both sessions.
    <ul>
        <li>first session: 10:30 - 14:30</li>
        <li>second session: 15:00 - 19:00</li>
    <ul>
    </li>
    <li>Sunday schedules should contain between 7 and 8 hours of content
    and start between 09.00 and 10.00 and run through until 17.00.</li>
    <li>No lunch breaks should be scheduled.   (Otherwise we'd make the
queueing-for-food problems even worse than they already are.)</li>
    <li>Schedule every talk - titles are used for video.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<h4>Scheduling in Pentabarf</h4>
To schedule a task in pentabarf you have to:
<ul>
    <li>In the <b>general tab</b>:
        <ul>
    <li>Make sure <b>event state</b> is "accepted"</li>
        <li id="slug">Set a unique <b>slug</b>.</li><br>
   Please set the 'Slug' to a unique memorable
   string (without spaces or non-ASCII characters) based on the title of
   the event.  The URL generated for the event is then:
   https://fosdem.org/2020/schedule/event/&lt;<b>slug</b>&gt;/<br>
   To group things to together nicely, you could put the same devroom
   prefix on them all, e.g.
     https://fosdem.org/2020/schedule/event/ada_.../
           </li>
           <li>
             Set the <b>progress</b> to "confirmed" or "reconfirmed" if you want it to appear on the website.
           </li>
        </ul>
    </li>   
    <li>In the <b>schedule</b> tab:
        <ul>
            <li>Set Day, start time, duration and room. </li>
            <li>Make sure Public event is checked</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    </ul>
    While going through all proposal it is also worth checking their content:
    <ul>
    <li>In the <b>persons</b> tab
        <ul>
            <li>Make sure the authors full name is present. There's also some understandable confusion about the name fields.
                  <ul><li> 
                   The 'Public Name' field should normally be left blank, and then
                   "Firstname Lastname" is generated automatically.
                  </li>
                  <li> To show a person's nickname, set the Public Name field to
                   "Firstname Lastname (Nickname)".<br>
                   
                   Unfortunately, the form
                      Firstname "Nickname" Lastname
                   is not currently supported by the code. 
                  </li>
                  <li>
                   (Only in rare cases will we hide the speaker's real name - e.g. if their
                   real name and nickname are not yet connected when you search the
                   internet.)
                  </li>
                   
            </li>
            <li>If a talk is presented by more than one author, you can add an extra speaker here (they must create a pentabarf account).</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
     In the <b>description</b> tab:
     <ul>
         <li>Make sure the abstract is not duplicated in the full description - both are concatenated. It is okay to leave the full description.</li>
         <li>Make sure the title is short and stands on its own. Long titles will get truncated in the booklet.</li>
     </ul> 
    </li>
</ul>
<h4>Inform your speakers</h4>
<p>Keep in mind that pentabarf does not send automatical emails. You have to inform your speakers yourself. 
<p>
Encourage your speakers to upload photographs and to
write short biographies.  If you add a speaker to the system yourself,
make sure you include a contact email address.
</p>
<h4>Scheduling hints</h4>
<ul>
<li>
For the main tracks we change over on the hour and there we suggest the
speakers talk for about 45 minutes, with 5 minutes of questions.  That
gives us a 10-minute buffer for changeover and means a slightly-late
finishing talk shouldn't prevent the next talk from starting on time.
</li>
<li>
Related / nearby devrooms should consider synchronising their time-slots
to reduce the disruption as people move around.
</li>
<li>
If your speakers are travelling long-distance and you're not sure whether
or not they're arriving a day or two early, schedule them later in the
day in case their journey is delayed.
Similarly, consider the home time-zone of speakers when scheduling
and allow for jet-lag.</li>
<li>
Keep a couple of talks in reserve in case speakers drop out at the last
minute.  Choose these from speakers you know will be attending the event
anyway and have the details in pentabarf ready so you can swap them in
with very little effort if you need to do so.</li>
<li>If you spot a rejected talk in the system that you are interested in, please be aware that the proposer might not yet know his talk was rejected. Contact the original devroom manager proposer to see if you can move it to your devroom, and only contact the presenter afterwards.
<br>
The easiest workflow is to change the track and change the status back
from rejected.
<br>
If you do this, add a note in the Notes box at the top to say what you
did (with username and date).
e.g. "Moved from Main Tracks to Lightning Talks - agk, 2016/12/10"
</li>
<li>
 So some of the lightning talks are in the PB system.  How would we
 schedule these?  It seems crazy to create a bunch of 5-minute slots.
<ul>
<li>
That's not crazy at all.  Please do this.
The video information gets generated from this, so it's the simplest way
to make sure the videos are tagged correctly. It would help for the booklets that the titles are very short. </li></ul></ul>

<h4>Website schedule</h4>
<p>
The website is generated from the data in pentabarf.
This runs automatically every few minutes.
</p>
<p>
You can see when it was last updated near the bottom of
   <a href="https://fosdem.org/2020/schedule/events/">the events page</a>
</p>
<p>
Note that the data gets pulled from the database slightly before
this timestamp is generated - sometimes a few minutes before.
If nothing on this page changed, the date won't be updated.
https://fosdem.org/2018/sitemap.xml shows the last modified
date for every page on the site.</p>
<p>
If the system detects an inconsistency in the data, it stops
updating the site until this is corrected in the database.
</p>
<h5>Troubleshooting</h5>
<p>
Pentabarf still does not detect if a speaker has been allocated two 
slots that
overlap so do watch out for that!
<p>
 <dl>
<dt> "Event with incorrectly named tag"?</dt>
<dd>
You've perhaps got some invalid characters in the slug?
First one I looked at with that message had spaces in it which I
removed.
Don't put '?' in a slug.</dd>
     <dt>Event with missing unique tag (slug)</dt>
<dd>Make sure you use a valid <a href="#slug">SLUG</a></dd>

<h2>During the event</h2>
<h3 id="timekeeping">Timekeeping</h3>
<p>
   One of the problems that has surfaced in some of the feedback from
   previous years is poor timekeeping in a small number of developer rooms.
   <br>
   Taking the size of the event, the desire of some people to switch
   between tracks, the live video streaming and the need for easy video
   cutting and review all together, it is absolutely essential that every
   room keeps strictly to time this year.
   <br>
   No talk may start early, for any reason - not even 10 seconds early,
   please.  Wait for the new minute to begin!  If you have an unexpected
   gap, fill it with Q&amp;A or discussion or ad-hoc lightning talks from your
   audience.  Make sure the timepiece being used is synchronised.
   <br>
   The published <b>start times</b> of talks must be adhered to.
   <br>
   If a speaker starts late for any reason, you should politely inform them
   that this means they just have less time to speak or to take questions
   and may need to go faster or to cut out some material.  Discuss what
   time signals they need, and be prepared to cut them off if need be so
   that the next speaker will be able to begin on time.
   <br>
   Talks need to finish in sufficient time for people to leave/enter the
   room and for the next speaker to be set up and ready to start on time.
   <br>
   If time is tight, the next speaker can set up their laptop during the
   Q&amp;A of the previous speaker.
</p>
