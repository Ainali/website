Q: Could you briefly introduce yourself?

**Merlijn:** I'm Merlijn Wajer aka 'Wizzup', a computer scientist and FOSS enthusiast
from Amsterdam, the Netherlands. I completed my Bachelor of Science in
Computer Science at the University of Amsterdam in 2012, I work for the
[Internet Archive](https://archive.org/) by day and I'm a (board) member of the Amsterdam
Hackerspace by night.

**Bart:** I'm Bart Ribbers, also known as "PureTryOut". I'm a typical nerd, having way 
too strong opinions on things most people don't care about. I'm studying 
software development at the HAN College in Arnhem, the Netherlands.

Q: What will your talk be about, exactly? Why this topic?

**Merlijn:** Our talk will present a brief history of GNU/Linux on smartphones,
present the current state of affairs, and zoom in on two projects:
[postmarketOS](https://postmarketos.org/) and [Maemo Leste](https://maemo-leste.github.io/). We will dive into what is currently
possible on (specific) smartphones, how Free (as in Freedom) various
devices are, what the goals of different projects are, and what lies ahead.

On a personal level, I (Merlijn) have been running GNU/Linux on my
(smart)phone for more than 10 years, in the form of Nokia's Maemo. Two
years ago, together with a few others we decided to bring this GNU/Linux
smartphone OS to the modern era, basing ourselves on the latest Debian
stable release, liberating (rewriting) components while we do so, while
attempting to stay API compatible.

We hope to bring to the community an operating system for the community,
by the community, free from any privacy issues and corporate interests.

**Bart:** Unlike Merlijn, I have never had the joy of running a proper Linux 
distribution on my phone(s). However, I've always messed around with custom 
ROMs and except for the first year of using an Android phone, I've never 
actually stuck with the ROM that the manufacturer pre-loaded on my device. 
Doing this I found out that you can extend the lifetime of your device by it, 
because you would often get a newer version of Android than your manufacturer 
would update you to. As nice as this is, I slowly realized this didn't 
address the real problem: the fact that the operating system is specific to 
your device. Why can we run a generic Linux distribution on any laptop around 
you and have it run fine for 10+ years, but do I need a specific version of a 
specific ROM specifically made for my smartphone?

Putting regular Linux distributions on mobile makes this problem disappear, 
as any package upgrade will get pushed to every device running that 
distribution at the same time.

Q: What do you hope to accomplish by giving this talk? What do you expect?

Our hope specifically is to raise awareness about our projects and other
GNU/Linux mobile operating systems and distributions, and to attract
passionate developers to help us complete our dream of a usable and
community maintained FOSS GNU/Linux device.

We expect mobile developers (who are working on mobile currently, or
have in the past) to show up to the talk, but also lots of people who
are just interested in running GNU/Linux on their device. Hopefully,
after the talk, lots of them will be excited enough to be helping out
(or trying out) our projects.

Q: There have been multiple attempts at getting a smartphone with GNU/Linux on the market, but none of them lasted for long. Why is that? Will it be different this time? 

We would argue that Maemo with the Nokia N900 was actually quite
successful at the time back in 2009, selling over 100,000 units in the
first 5 weeks. We know what happened to Nokia after that --- the main
reason no one could pick up their work was because many of their
components were not open source. The same is true for Sailfish OS by
Jolla now --- they use an open source base, but their user interface and
key applications (like Android emulation) are not open source, and will
die with them if or when they do. Jolla had promised to open source
their UI many years ago, but they never came through on that promise,
We don't know why.

By creating an open source mobile ecosystem that is entirely open
source, has no corporate backing (and no stakeholders), our work will
not just disappear into the abyss. (It might go forgotten eventually,
but it will still be there: for people to look at and hack on whenever
they want).

Our aim is not to dominate the market, but to provide a place for
people who want to use the system --- not unlike Linux on the desktop ---
when did that (year of Linux on the desktop) ever happen? Yet we still
highly value our Linux desktop environments --- for a good reason, they
provide us with a trustworthy platform free from corporate backing. I
would argue that we need the same for our mobile phones.

NLNet wrote about [why we need alternative mobile Linux systems](https://nlnet.nl/project/MaemoLeste/). We thought it was quite well considered and raises some
points that aren't often raised as arguments for alternative platforms.

Q: 2020 marks the 20th anniversary of (F)OSDEM. What contributions has FOSDEM made to the advancement of FOSS?

Providing a place year after year where FOSS enthusiasts can come
together we think has been very valuable, to get a bigger part of the
community involved. Having a venue for developers to share their work
with the world --- arguably the most fun aspect of FOSS projects, is
something we direly need and will continue to need.

Q: Have you enjoyed previous FOSDEM editions? 

**Merlijn:** Absolutely, I have been coming for over 10 years already. Too bad about
the weather sometimes, though... (Hey --- the Dutch always complain about
the weather, so I figured I'd end the interview on that note.)

**Bart:** Massively! Like I mentioned in my introduction, I always have strong 
opinions on (technical) subjects that most people don't care about. FOSDEM 
gives me a place to discuss these things with people that _do_ care. Also, 
it's very nice to see some real life faces behind the nicknames I always 
encounter in the Matrix rooms.
