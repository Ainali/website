Q: Could you briefly introduce yourself?

I'm 41 years old and a hacker from the BBS times, loved programming
all my life (started on a C64, then Amiga as a demo scener); I do love
literature and humanities and became a scholar in philosophy of
technology.

I'm very happy today I can do the work I love: writing free and open
source software for [Dyne.org](https://www.dyne.org). Once upon a time I was into audio/video
DSP but nowadays applied cryptography (especialy EC) makes my day.

My favorite shell is [Zsh](https://www.zsh.org/), my favorite languages are C and some LISP
dialects, my favorite philosopher is Michel Foucault, my favorite
music genre is Jazz and of course my favorite distro is [Devuan](https://devuan.org/) :^)

Q: What will your talk be about, exactly? Why this topic?

I'll be talking about Algorithmic Sovereignty, which is also the topic
of my doctoral dissertation, as well that of many valuable researches
for which the website [AlgoSov.org](https://AlgoSov.org) serves as a good summary.

The topic is pretty important today, I believe, since technology is
evolving at a very rapid pace and towards rather incommensurable
complexity - ever heard the "innovation" magic word? ;^) - and that
makes participants (all users and developers and sysadmins) less in
control of what is happening.

Q: What do you hope to accomplish by giving this talk? What do you expect?

I will be exploring various aspects of this scenario, not just to
understand who is in control of present and future technology, but
also what are the impacts on our personal and professional lives, and
how can we overcome this trend and envision ways of development that
are still bottom up, inclusive and community based.

I expect the audience to react to this talk in a creative way and
wonder around the foundational principles that have started
communities as the FOSDEM one itself.

Q: What was your breakthrough insight that algorithms have power over us?

The narrative of free and open source software is foundational to this
awareness, but to quote a recent example the episode of Pokemon Go was
really a splash. That's why I love the artwork by Pawel Kuczynski
which is shown on the AlgoSov.org website.

I explore the topic more in depth in [an interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dTZD9iJHOSc) made more than a
year ago, but still very actual I believe.

Q: Users of free and open source software enjoy the benefit of transparency of algorithms, but is that enough for algorithmic sovereignty? And How can non-developers influence an algorithm?

This is an important question that helps me make my point. I believe
that the transparency of algorithms is not enough of a condition to
establish the sovereignty of participants adopting them. As we see
software governing more and more the way we live (with trends as
smart cities, internet of things, social networks, etc.) we need to go
beyond the licensing model of software and look at its purpose and
most important at what ways partipants are offered in order to
influence and adapt the system to their needs and desires.

People who are not fluent in programming languages can still help a
lot this process, since developers alone are hardly able to
contemplate and understand human needs when their software is in
action.

Q: What are some practical examples of things that FOSS developers can do to improve algorithmic sovereignty?

I believe the UNIX philosophy gives us many hints on how to, from the perspective of software design: lower complexity, do one thing and do it well, make software easily interoperable, agree on common protocols, avoid lock-in scenarios, etc. are all design approaches which also improve security.

Last but not least: design for awareness. Make people aware of what happens, in a simple way (that's a challenge!), rather than hide complexity.

Q: At the end of 2017, you released the first version of Dowse, a system that lets you understand what devices are doing on your home network and can turn their internet access off. Are there any new developments in Dowse?

Sure! I've summarised some developments that are still in the works in [an interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p5LozWuENE).

We have been running workshops all over the world also with art and
design students, the last ones were in Taipei and Huangzhou, fantastic
experiences --- and interesting to see Dowse work in dire network
situations.

The project has also inspired several researchers in the field of
ethics and in particular was prominently featured as good practice by
the [Virt-EU](http://virteuproject.eu) project on "Values and Ethics in Innovation for
Responsible Technology in Europe".

Q: Have you enjoyed previous FOSDEM editions?

Absolutely yes, FOSDEM and FSCONS are my favorite free software
conferences. FOSDEM is bigger and therefore a bit disorienting, but I
really enjoy talking to any perfect stranger finding out we have tons
of things in common and a lot of arguments to debate fervently, even
beyond the Emacs and Vim debacle :^) Try starting a conversation about
shells or programming languages anywhere and within minutes you'll
find the debate has grown into a whole circle of people where everyone
has an opinion :^D I love that.
