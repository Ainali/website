Q: Could you two briefly introduce yourselves?

[Justin W. Flory](https://justinwflory.com/) is a creative maker. He is best-known as an open
source contributor based in the United States. Since 2018, Justin is a
leading member of the [LibreCorps](https://fossrit.github.io/librecorps/) program of the [FOSS@MAGIC](https://fossrit.github.io/about/)
initiative at the Rochester Institute of Technology. He was the first,
full-time co-op placement to work exclusively on community issues for
[UNICEF Office of Innovation](https://www.unicef.org/innovation/). This was work he did in concert with
UNICEF personnel and Red Hat Open Innovations Lab on UNICEF’s
[MagicBox](https://www.unicef.org/innovation/Magicbox) effort. Since then, Justin led workshops for UNICEF’s
Innovation Fund to introduce over 20 international start-up teams to the
Open Source way. Currently, he works as a consultant for open source
projects and community-building. Using Justin’s initial efforts with
MagicBox as a starting point, RIT’s current LibreCorps mentors build
interactive resources for clients.

[Mike Nolan](https://nolski.rocks/) is a software engineer and open source community strategy
consultant working with the [UNICEF Innovation Fund](https://unicefinnovationfund.org/) to assist in
developing sustainable open source community strategies. The other half
of his time, he’s working as a core contributor for the [OpenMined](https://www.openmined.org/)
project, helping to build an open source framework for privacy
preserving, federated, machine learning. With work experience stemming
from tech companies such as Amazon and GIPHY to large humanitarian
organizations such as the International Rescue Committee and UNICEF, he
seeks to blend the best of fast-paced technology development with the
policy-driven world of humanitarianism.

Q: What will your talk be about, exactly? Why this topic?

How do we make an AI system more ethical and respect our rights?

Our talk is about creating a vision. The Free Software community formed
around [four basic freedoms of software](https://fsfe.org/freesoftware/basics/4freedoms.en.html): freedom to read software
source, to run it how you like, to remix and make changes, and to
redistribute your changes with others. But now, we live in a world where
software is making automated decisions for us. Artificial intelligence
is more than just software, but it is also about data and predictive
models. So, our talk is about creating a vision of AI systems that
respect our freedoms and how we might go about designing such systems.

Q: What do you hope to accomplish by giving this talk? What do you expect?

The history of the Free Software movement teaches us a lot about how we
got to where we are today. We want to inspire our audience to think
critically about artificial intelligence from our collective perspective
as members of the Free Software community, and also give the audience
some concrete ideas to take away for how we tackle this together as a
global community. The values, ethics, and history of the Free Software
movement are an essential part of what we are presenting.

Q: What has changed over the last 20 years in the domain of AI systems?

The answer is probably in your pocket or your hand.

Today, AI is everywhere around us. More decisions are being automated
for us by machines. Sometimes this results in positive changes, like
early detection of cancer. Other times, the changes are harmful, such as
a predictive model to detect early stages of cancer being less effective
on people of color. In today’s world, “ethics and AI” are being talked
about more, but the conversations are in small pockets. From our
perspective, we are seeing societal changes in our humanitarian work,
driven by AI systems. “Fairness criteria” and removing bias is not
enough. We can’t program our way out of this one.

If the past 20 years saw the proliferation of automated decision-making,
we need to envision, together, the next 20 years that create AI system
that protect our essential freedoms as users.

Q: 2020 marks the 20th anniversary of (F)OSDEM. What contributions has FOSDEM made to the advancement of FOSS, or how did you in particular benefit from FOSDEM?

FOSDEM is unique to us as a collection of various disciplines and
backgrounds across the Free Software world. As such, we felt that it
would be an excellent venue to debut our talk to explore AI and our
essential freedoms as users and designers of automated systems.

Q: Have you enjoyed previous FOSDEM editions?

This is not our first time coming to FOSDEM and we are glad to be a part
of this 20-year tradition in Brussels. FOSDEM has always been an
opportunity for us to connect with other folks in the Free Software
world and learn what other people are doing. We are looking forward to
sharing our knowledge and learning from others this year!
