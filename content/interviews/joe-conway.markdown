Q: Could you briefly introduce yourself?

Hi, I'm Joe Conway. I currently live in Florida, USA, and work for
Crunchy Data. I have been working with [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) pretty much daily for
over 20 years, and I have been an active part of the community for most of that
time. Currently I am a PostgreSQL Committer, Major Contributor, and
Infrastructure Team member.

Q: What will your talk be about, exactly? Why this topic?

My talk is about how to use Linux SECCOMP together with PostgreSQL in
order to reduce your attack surface and provide better security. This is
just one aspect of what should be a holistic effort to secure your data.

This topic is important because breaches continue to happen with
increasing frequency, and you don't want to be included in the next
headline regarding such things!

Q: What do you hope to accomplish by giving this talk? What do you expect?

I hope to make more people aware of Linux SECCOMP and how it can be used
with PostgreSQL to enhance security. I expect that some viewers will be
inspired to try some of the things I talk about, and hopefully deploy them.

Q: You have been involved with the PostgreSQL community for more than 20 years. Could you give us a retrospect: what has changed over the last 20 years in PostgreSQL?

When I first became involved, the community was relatively small and very enthusiastic about doing things the right way. Back then, there was a lot of low hanging fruit --- many of the problems to be solved were simpler and more fundamental than the problems of today. The typical use cases were constrained in size and complexity.

The community has grown tremendously over the years, and the user-base
has grown even more quickly. An entire ecosystem has developed, which is
still dedicated to doing things the right way and making PostgreSQL the
best solution for everyone --- including for extremely large enterprises
and huge government agencies.

The problems being solved today are much more complex. They use multiple
systems and involve enormous databases. Everyone wants to automate all
the things! Data is more valuable than ever and therefore more
vulnerable to attack. But PostgreSQL (the software and the community)
continues to rise to the challenges.

Q: 2020 marks the 20th anniversary of (F)OSDEM. What contributions has FOSDEM made to the advancement of FOSS, and how did PostgreSQL in particular benefit from FOSDEM?

PostgreSQL leverages many aspects of the FOSS systems that it sits atop.
It depends on operating system services. Successful deployment and
management require many other components, the vast majority of which
(and in many cases, all) are FOSS.

To the extent that FOSDEM has helped the world grow and develop world
class FOSS software, that we all run our businesses on, PostgreSQL and
its users have benefited. PostgreSQL advances by "standing upon the
shoulders of giants", and FOSDEM is one of the giants of the FOSS
software world.

Q: Have you enjoyed previous FOSDEM editions?

Yes, I have attended FOSDEM several times in the past, and I am very
much looking forward to the 2020 edition! I hope to see everyone there.
