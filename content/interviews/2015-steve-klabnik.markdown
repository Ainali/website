Q: Could you briefly introduce yourself?

Hi there, I'm Steve. *waves*.

I am a human in a constant state of flux, like many of us. This
current iteration of me features:

 * Lots of GitHub. [This](https://github.com/steveklabnik/) says I've
done over two thousand bits of contribution in the past year.
 * Lots of [Rust](http://blog.rust-lang.org/2014/12/12/Core-Team.html).
 * Lots of [Netrunner](http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_minisite.asp?eidm=207).

Q: What will your talk be about, exactly? Why this topic? 

I'll be talking about [Rust](http://www.rust-lang.org/) and its
journey to 1.0. Rust is a highly anticipated new programming language,
and now, around the time it's finally shipping, is a good chance to
get a bit of a retrospective.

Q: What do you hope to accomplish by giving this talk? What do you expect? 

I'd love for people to give Rust a try.

Q: In which domains does Rust shine? And what are currently its weak points? 

Rust is really great when you can't afford a garbage collector. It can
go just as low as C and C++ can, but is much, much more safe.

Rust's weakest point is that its domain is difficult, and so the
language can be a bit tough to get started with.

Q: Could you give some examples of projects that are developed in Rust? 

One great example is Rust itself! The compiler is written in Rust.

Another is [Cargo](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/), Rust's
package manager. Its website, [Crates.io](http://crates.io) also uses
Rust on the back end.

[Skylight](https://www.skylight.io/) is one of the first production
users of Rust. Their Ruby gem you install on your site is Rust on the
inside.

[Servo](https://github.com/servo/servo) is a web rendering engine
written in Rust.

Q: Is Rust easy to learn? Which programming language background do you recommend for someone who wants to try Rust? 

Rust is easy to get started with, but can be a bit confusing depending
on your background. Rust blends approaches from many domains, so if
you come from C++, the advanced type system stuff might be hard. If
you come from Haskell, the low-level stuff may seem strange.

I think anyone coming from a C++ background will find Rust easy to
understand. Lots of people from languages like Ruby, Python, and
JavaScript are finding that Rust is a good excuse to learn low-level
programming, so that's another way to do it.

Q: Which new features can we expect in Rust this year? 

The big one is 1.0. :) Finally, some stability! We don't have a
schedule set in stone for post 1.0, though we have some ideas!

Q: Have you enjoyed previous FOSDEM editions? 

This will be my first FOSDEM!
