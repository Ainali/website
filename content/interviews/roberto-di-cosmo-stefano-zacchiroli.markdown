Q: Could you two briefly introduce yourself?

   - **Roberto**: I'm a computer scientist, full professor at University Paris
     Diderot, a hacker, a writer, and a citizen who believes we can build
     together a better world through science, technology, philosophy and
     community.  Some of my past achievements are
     [DemoLinux](http://www.demolinux.org/) (one of the first live
     distributions), [Mancoosi](http://www.mancoosi.org) (a project dedicated
     to improving package management for FOSS distributions),
     [Irill](http://www.irill.org) (a research space focused on Free Software)
     and the [Free Software thematic group in the Paris
     region](http://www.systematic-paris-region.org/en/get-info-topics/free-and-open-source-software)
     (that helps fund research and development projects in Free Software).

   - **Stefano**: On the research side, I'm an associate professor of Computer
     Science at University Paris Diderot currently on leave at Inria to work on
     Software Heritage; I've done research work on formal methods, Free/Open
     Source Software engineering, and now software preservation. On the Free
     Software activism side, I've been a Debian Developer since 2001, where I
     was elected to serve as Debian Project Leader for 3 terms in a row over
     the period 2010-2013. I'm a Board Director of the Open Source Initiative
     (OSI), a member of FSF's High Priority Projects Committee, and a recipient
     of the 2015 O'Reilly Open Source Award.

Q: What will your talk be about, exactly? Why this topic?

   Our society has grown to depend on software for every aspect of our life,
   and an increasing part of this software is Free/Open Source Software, and
   constitutes our software commons. We survey the state of this precious part
   of our knowledge, and provide concrete evidence of why it has now become
   necessary to take action in order to ensure its preservation and broad
   accessibility.  [Software Heritage](http://www.softwareheritage.org) has as
   its mission to address this challenge, by collecting, preserving, and
   sharing all publicly available software in source code form, with all its
   development history.

   In our FOSDEM 2017 talk we will detail the basic philosophical and
   organisational principles of Software Heritage, and present its technical
   architecture as well as the challenges that underlie the construction of the
   largest source code archive ever built.
   
Q: What do you hope to accomplish by giving this talk? What do you expect?

   Software Heritage is an open initiative engineered for the long term, with
   societal, technical, scientific and industrial implications. It comes with
   many organisational and technical challenges, and it is instrumental for its
   success that developers and users of software get rapidly involved.  We hope
   with this talk to raise awareness of the challenges we are facing, and
   attract contributors to this exciting mission.

Q: What's the history of the Software Heritage project? Why was it started? How did it evolve? Is this what you planned it to be?

   The first informal discussions on what has now become Software Heritage
   started back in the spring of 2014, (as often happens, around a coffee
   machine and a tea pot) at [IRILL](http://www.irill.org) in Paris. After
   having explored the state of the art, charted related initiatives, and
   elaborated the vision we now proudly share, we got the needed initial
   support from [Inria](http://www.inria.fr/en) around mid-2015.  During the
   summer of 2015, our initial infrastructure was set up, and the operations
   for collecting the source code repositories started. We are especially happy
   to have arrived just in time to collect the contents of [Gitorious](https://gitorious.org/) and [Google Code](https://code.google.com/) before it was too late, thanks to some wonderful people (at the Archive
   Team and Google, respectively) that were eager to help.

Q: What challenges did you encounter while building the Software Heritage archive?

   On a project of this breadth and scope, you are bound to face a variety of
   challenges, and we did indeed face both organisational and technical
   challenges, that you will of course hear about in our talk. Our biggest
   challenge today is to raise awareness and pave the way to make it simple for
   contributors to come and lend a hand.

Q: How can interested people contribute to the Software Heritage project? In which domains could you use some help?
   
   There are many areas where people can contribute. Software Heritage is an
   amazing playground for developers: one can help automating the collection of
   source code from any of the great number of repositories spread around
   all the planet, or write an importer to handle any of the broad variety of
   version control systems. And that's just the tip of the iceberg: we need
   efficient storage structures, fast search algorithms, etc. And even if you
   do not have time to contribute to the technical infrastructure, your help in
   raising awareness will be precious too.
   
Q: Have you enjoyed previous FOSDEM editions?

   Among the two of us we have attended every FOSDEM edition except the first
   one (that was run under a different name, so arguably we haven't missed any
   FOSDEM :-P). So, you bet, we have very much enjoyed previous FOSDEM editions
   and we are big fans of the event. In our experience with FOSS-related
   conferences around the world, FOSDEM is /the/ FOSS community conference,
   nothing else matches its ability to unite together such a wide and diverse
   community of communities of FOSS hackers. Keep it up!
