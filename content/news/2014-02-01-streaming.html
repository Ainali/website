title: Streaming

<p>
    For the first time ever, FOSDEM is streaming all main tracks and most
    devrooms at <a href="http://streaming.fosdem.org/">http://streaming.fosdem.org/</a>.

    This is on a best-effort basis; in particular, the U building
    is not streamed. The streams are in WebM format, and should work in most
    modern browsers and phones. Video distribution is sponsored by
    <a href="http://cloud.google.com/products/compute-engine/">Google Compute Engine</a>.

    Please note that our priority is recording.  The streams are best-effort!
    Nevertheless, should you experience problems, please contact us on #fosdem
    on IRC. Thanks!
