<p>
    For FOSDEM 2021, we make a mix of the original recording submitted by the presenter and the Q&A happening in the main room. To
    make sure that the result is up to our quality standards, we request that the original presenter reviews the video so the result
    contains no errors or mistakes. This can take a while.
</p>
<p>
    We expect that it will take some days to some weeks for all videos to become available at
    <a href="https://video.fosdem.org/2021/">video.fosdem.org/2021</a>.
