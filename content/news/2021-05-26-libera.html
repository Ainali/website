title: A new home for our IRC presence

<p>
The FOSDEM IRC channels have been moved to the
<a href="https://libera.chat">Libera.Chat</a> network.
</p>

<p>
Please join us on the <a href="ircs://irc.libera.chat:6697/fosdem">#fosdem
	channel</a> there. All other #fosdem-* channels and the Matrix bridge will be
available soon.

<p>
As some of our previous channels on the FreeNode network have been taken over by
the new staff, these channels are no longer affiliated with FOSDEM. The FOSDEM
organisation is saddened by this act of hostility towards the community.
</p>

<p>
We urge our users to leave these channels as soon as possible and move to the
new ones on Libera.Chat.
</p>

<p>
We would like to remind you that any channel using the FOSDEM name or anyone
posing as FOSDEM staff on other IRC networks is not affiliated with the FOSDEM
organisation.
