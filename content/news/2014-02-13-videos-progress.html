title: Video transcoding progressing
---
<p>
  Transcoding of our videos is making progress. We're not finished yet,
  however, and your help is welcome!
</p>
---MORE---
<p>
  There are many transcoded videos already visible on our <a
  href='http://video.fosdem.org'>video archive</a>. However, some
  videos do have issues, and we have neither the time nor the manpower
  to review <em>all</em> videos in minute detail.
</p>
<p>
  We would therefore like to ask for some help from the community: if
  you see some issues with one or more videos on the video archive,
  it would be helpful if you could inform us.</p>
<p>
  Examples of problems we've so far encountered include:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Misassociation (a video named after one talk actually containing
    another)</li>
  <li>Missing audio (image, but no sound, or static rather than
    sound)</li>
  <li>Incorrect timings (the talk starts many minutes before or after
    the start of the video</li>
</ul>
<p>
  It's of course also possible that there are other issues which we've
  not yet identified.
</p> 
<p>All reports of issues are welcome on the <a
  href='mailto:video@lists.fosdem.org'>video mailinglist</a>.
