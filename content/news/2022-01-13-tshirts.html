title: 'T-shirts and hoodies available!'
---
<p>
    An important part of our programme: the T-shirts and hoodies. They are (again) available, and contrary to normal practices,
    you won't have to stand in line to get them and they won't run out!
</p>

<p>
   For the online edition, we partnered with a print-on-demand provider, which means that they won't run out at Saturday noon,
   as they normally do.

   Two batches will be produced, one before FOSDEM and one after.
   The order cut-off dates are <b>Sunday 16th January 2022</b> 
   and <b>Sunday 13th February 2022</b>.

    If you can't find your country in either of the shops, send an e-mail to <i>treasure-at-fosdem-dot-org</i> with

    find out if it is possible.
