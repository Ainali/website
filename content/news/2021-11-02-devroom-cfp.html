<p>
  We now invite proposals for developer rooms for FOSDEM 2022.
  Invitations to submit proposals for other elements of the event 
  will follow in the next couple of weeks.

<p>
  FOSDEM offers open source and free software developers a place to
  meet, share ideas and collaborate.  Renowned for being highly
  developer-oriented, the event brings together some 8000+ geeks from
  all over the world.
</p>

<p>
  The twenty-second edition will take place Saturday 5th and Sunday 6th
  February 2022, online.
</p>

<p>
  Developer rooms are assigned to self-organising groups to work together
  on open source and free software projects, to discuss topics relevant to
  a broader subset of the community, etc. Most content should take the
  form of presentations. Proposals involving collaboration across project
  or domain boundaries are strongly encouraged.
</p>

<p>
  For obvious reasons, unfortunately we will be unable to run a physical
  conference in Brussels this year, but we would still like to give 
  communities a place to meet online.
</p>

<p>
  We are using Matrix, an online platform (streaming and chat) allowing
  devroom organizers to run the conference primarily using pre-recorded talks
  with some live content including Q&amp;A sessions and discussion panels,
  with streaming and archiving.
  The recordings will be published under the same licence as all FOSDEM
  content (CC-BY).
  Note that the demand for devrooms may exceed the supply - even for an
  online event!
</p>

<p>
  Devroom managers must enter a complete schedule into our conference
  system by 31st December. They will also be responsible for
  recruiting sufficient volunteers to work with the speakers to create
  pre-recordings during January and to carry out various new roles 
  necessary to product a smooth online event.
  We think a typical devroom will need to find a pool of at least five
  volunteers this year.
</p>

<p>
  Developer room proposals should be submitted through the form at
  <a href="https://fosdem.org/devroom">https://fosdem.org/devroom</a>
  which contains further information.
  When applying, please indicate your preferred devroom duration 
  and any preferred split between the two days.
