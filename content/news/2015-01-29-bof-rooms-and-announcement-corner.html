title: BoF rooms and announcement corner
---

<p>
  Just like previous editions, we will have two rooms for birds of a feather
  sessions. We will also provide some space for announcements and job openings.

  The concept is simple: any project or community can reserve a timeslot
  (fifteen minutes to an hour), during which they have the room just to
  themselves.
</p>

<p>
  These rooms are intended for ad-hoc discussions, meet-ups or brainstorming
  sessions. They are not a replacement for a developer room and they are
  certainly not intended for talks. The rooms are deliberately not equipped
  with projectors. The rooms are small and cosy. There are seats for
  approximately thirty people.
</p>

<p>
  Reservations can be made only during the event and are on a first-come,
  first-served basis. The signup sheets will be at the infodesk in the H
  building.
</p>

<p>
  The announcement and job corner can be found in the H building, opposite room
  H.1301 (Cornil).
