title: Pushing IPv6
---
<p>
    For the first time this year, the <code>FOSDEM</code> wireless network will
    be IPv6-only.

<p>
    FOSDEM is a unique opportunity to confront thousands of developers with an
    IPv6-only reality.  We are hopeful that making our default network
    IPv6-only will encourage people to fix bugs in applications and devices.
</p>
<p>
    The <code>FOSDEM</code> network has NAT64 and DNS64 transition measures in
    place for communicating with the legacy internet.  For those who need it,
    the <code>FOSDEM-dualstack</code> wireless network will provide the same
    dual stack connectivity we offered on <code>FOSDEM</code> in previous years.
</p>
<ul>
	<li><code>FOSDEM</code>: IPv6-only, provides NAT64 and DNS64.  Recursive
	DNS resolvers announced with RA and DHCPv6.  If you need to configure
	DNS manually, use <code>2001:67c:1810:f056::2</code> and
	<code>2001:41d0:2:1959:21c:c0ff:fe88:6f58</code></li>
	<li><code>FOSDEM-v6</code>: Identical to <code>FOSDEM</code>!  Should
	<code>FOSDEM</code> need to revert to dual stack for any reason
	(hopefully not), this network will remain available as IPv6-only.</li>
	<li><code>FOSDEM-dualstack</code>: provides native IPv6 and legacy IP
	connectivity.  No DNS64.</li>
</ul>
