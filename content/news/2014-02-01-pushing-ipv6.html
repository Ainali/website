    For the first time this year, the <code>FOSDEM</code> wireless network will
    be IPv6-only.

<p>
    FOSDEM is a unique opportunity to confront thousands of developers with an
    IPv6-only reality.  We are hopeful that making our default network
    IPv6-only will encourage people to fix bugs in applications and devices.

<p>
    The <code>FOSDEM</code> network has NAT64 and DNS64 transition measures in
    place for communicating with the legacy internet.  For those who need it,
    the <code>FOSDEM-dualstack</code> wireless network will provide the same
    dual stack connectivity we offered on <code>FOSDEM</code> in previous years.
