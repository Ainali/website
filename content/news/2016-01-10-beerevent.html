<p>
  Looking for something to do the evening before FOSDEM?
</p>

---MORE---

<p>
  Like every year, many FOSDEM attendees are planning to enjoy some beers at the
  <a href="http://www.deliriumcafe.be/">Delirium Caf&eacute;</a>, in a beautiful
  alley near the
  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Place">Grand Place</a>
  in Brussels.
  We have reserved most of the bar (most of the alley in fact!) again this year.
</p>

<p>
  Come and join us at the eve of FOSDEM, on Friday the 29th of January. You are welcome
  as of 16h00.
</p>

<p>Read the <a href="page:/beerevent">beer event page</a> for all the details!</p>

<p>
  If the beer event is very busy or if you would like dinner before heading over
  (Delirium Caf√© does not serve food), a number of other events are on. Check
  <a href="https://lists.fosdem.org/mailman/listinfo/fosdem">fosdem@ mailing
  list</a> for more announcements.
</p>

<p>
  Alternatively there are plenty of local restaurants within ten minutes walk of
  the Delirium&mdash;you can't miss them! There are plenty of rating sites to help
  you choose and avoid being disappointed.
</p>

<p>See you there!</p>

<p>PS: Drink wisely. Belgian beers are stronger than you might be used to. <code>:-)</code>
