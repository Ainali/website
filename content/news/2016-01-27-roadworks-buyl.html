title: Roadworks near ULB Solbosch
---

<p>Like last year, there are roadworks on Av Buyl near the ULB Solbosch
campus. This affects travellers coming by car or public transport.</p>

---MORE---

<h3>By car</h3>

<p>Please be aware that the entrance to the campus on Av Buyl is
completely blocked due to roadworks: the only access to and from the
parking is via Av Roosevelt. Also note that this means the narrow and
steep ramp is now two-way traffic so be very careful, especially in bad
weather.</p>

<h3>Public transport</h3>

<p>Like last year, buses and trams will avoid Av Buyl. When coming by
tram line 25 or 94 you can switch to a replacement bus service at
Legrand or at Cambre-Étoile. This T-bus will stop at ULB on Av
Roosevelt.</p>

<p>Using bus line 71, you can walk to the ULB from the stop at Buyl or at
Cimetière d'Ixelles, while bus 72 will still stop near the ULB (via a
detour).</p>

<h3>Shuttle buses</h3>

<p>The free shuttle buses, taking visitors from FOSDEM to the Brussels
South (Midi) railway station on Sunday evening, will depart from Av
Roosevelt this year. The location will be clearly indicated.</p>
