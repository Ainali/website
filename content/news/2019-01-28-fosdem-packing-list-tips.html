<ul>
    <li>Warm clothing and also an umbrella or raincoat, weather predictions say around freezing temperatures and a moderate chance of rain/snow. </li>
    <li>Chargers for the laptop and smart devices you bring.</li>
    <li>Power adapter plug that fits in a Belgian power outlet.</li>
    <li>Some cash money, most catering vans accept cards and cash, but for purchases at stands and the beer-event cash might be the only option. There is a cash machine at the campus but from experience we know that it runs out of cash quickly.</li>
</ul>

<p>There will be a staffed cloackroom located in building K. So you can leave your coat there if you don't need it after all, or for storing your luggage on sunday if you immediatly turn back home after the event.</p>
