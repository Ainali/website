title: Call for volunteers
---

<p>With FOSDEM just around the corner, it is time for us to enlist your help.</p>

---MORE---

<p>
  Every year, an enthusiastic band of volunteers helps us make FOSDEM a fun and
  safe place for all our attendees. We could not do this without you. This year
  we again need as many hands as possible, especially during the buildup
  (starting Friday at noon) and teardown (Sunday evening). No need to worry
  about missing lunch. Food will be provided.
</p>

<p>
  If you have some spare time during weekend and would like to be a part of
  the team that makes FOSDEM tick:
</p>

<p>We need help with the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Setting up the venue on Friday: this mostly involves carrying tables to
    their destinations and setting them up, putting up signage, covering the
    walls in brown paper, ... in short: transform the campus into a conference
    venue. We need as many volunteers as possible for this task.
  </li>
  <li>
    Deploying the network on Friday: rolling out, neatly securing and crimping
    UTP cables. People with experience rolling out networks and crimping cables
    are very welcome!
  </li>
  <li>
    Manning the infodesk during the weekend: help out fellow attendees with
    their questions, sell t-shirts, ... . Proficiency in English is a must, but
    if you know other languages, it certainly wouldn't hurt.
  </li>
  <li>
    Heralds: briefly introduce the speakers and the topics of their talks, make
    sure all talks end on time by giving speakers cues near the end of their
    time slot. Keep an eye out on room safety and report potential issues such
    as overcrowded rooms before it becomes more than a "potential" issue.
  </li>
  <li>
    Safety: keep an eye out for hazardous situations such as patches of ice that
    could trip people up, overcrowded rooms, ... This also involves barring
    entrance to rooms that are at full capacity so we can keep the conference
    safe for everyone. This can be combined with moderation.
  </li>
  <li>
    Teardown and cleanup on Sunday evening: collecting beer bottles, tearing
    down the network, pulling brown paper off the walls, taking down the signage,
    stacking the rental tables in neat heaps, broom the floors, ... Basically, make
    sure we're welcome again next year. ;)
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  If any or all of these sound like your kind of gig, pick your task(s)
at <a href="https://volunteers.fosdem.org">https://volunteers.fosdem.org</a> and subscribe to the
  <a href="https://lists.fosdem.org/listinfo/volunteers">volunteers
mailing list</a>. Feel free to shout out and introduce yourself!
</p>

<p>
  In addition to general volunteer work, we are also looking for volunteers
  specifically to help out with video-related work. This involves:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Operating a camera in one of the many rooms which will be recorded by the
    FOSDEM video team;
  </li>
  <li>Regulating the audio in one of the rooms;</li>
  <li>or operating the DVswitch station.</li>
</ul>

<p>
  While A/V experience is of course always welcome, all that's really needed is
  that you're interested; on-the-job training will be provided.
</p>

<p>
  People interested in helping out with the video team should subscribe to the
  <a href="https://lists.fosdem.org/listinfo/video">video team mailing list</a>
  before the event. Important announcements will be made there, and be prepared
  to join us on IRC during the event.
</p>

<p>
  Note that it's perfectly okay to subscribe to both. Just make sure to let the
  respective coordinators know when necessary.
