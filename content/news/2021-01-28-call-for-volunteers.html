title: 'Call for Volunteers'

<p>
  With this year’s virtual edition of FOSDEM fast approaching, we look
  forward to inviting you to volunteer to help support the running
  of the event.

<p>
  The twenty-first edition will take place Saturday 6th and Sunday 7th
  February 2021, online.  We will be running a variety of streams 
  including Developer Rooms, Stands, Main Tracks and Lightning Talks.
</p>

<p>
  Because we are sadly unable to meet in person at the ULB in Brussels,
  a lot of our usual tasks will be superfluous - don’t worry, we
  won’t send you to an attendee’s house to help clean up a spilled
  drink!  There will also not be a build-up or tear-down, as much of
  this has been automated with bots and scripts.
</p>

<p>
  However, being in a new conference environment (thanks to the amazing
  support from the folk over at <a href="https://matrix.org/">matrix.org</a>)
  our virtual <em>InfoDesk</em> will be super important, helping answer all the
  questions that attendees may have, and providing some basic technical
  support to anyone who may need it.
</p>

<p>
  This year, we also are renaming the Heralding task to *Hosting*.
  Our hosts will be key to supporting the speakers during their Q&amp;A
  sessions, keeping all aspects around that talk running smoothly, and
  (on the off chance of there being any issues) raising these with a
  member of FOSDEM staff.
</p>

<p>
  So, do you feel up to the task of helping the machine that is FOSDEM
  run this special online edition? Great! That’s the spirit – you
