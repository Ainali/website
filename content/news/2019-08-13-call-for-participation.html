<p>
  FOSDEM offers open source and free software developers a place to
  meet, share ideas and collaborate.  Renowned for being highly
  developer-oriented, the event brings together some 8000+ geeks from
  all over the world.
</p>

<p>
  The twentieth edition will take place on Saturday 1st and Sunday 2nd
  February 2020 at the usual location: ULB Campus Solbosch in Brussels.
</p>

<p>
  We will record and stream all main tracks, devrooms and lightning talks live.
  The recordings will be published under the same licence as all FOSDEM content
  (CC-BY). If, exceptionally, you believe there is a legitimate reason why your
  presentation should not be streamed or recorded, you must seek our agreement
  before submitting it.
</p>


<h3>Main Tracks</h3>

<p>
  Previous editions have featured main tracks centered around security,
  operating system development, community building, and many other topics.
  Presentations are expected to be 50 minutes long (including audience
  questions) and should cater to a varied technical audience.  The conference
  covers reasonable travel expenses agreed in advance and arranges
  accommodation for accepted main track speakers if needed.
</p>

<p>
  Proposals for main track presentations should be submitted using
  Pentabarf: <a href="https://fosdem.org/submit">https://fosdem.org/submit</a>.

  form of presentations. Proposals involving collaboration across project
  or domain boundaries are strongly encouraged.
