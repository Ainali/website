title: 'Visit FOSDEM 2021: attending a talk'
---
<p>
    FOSDEM is all about talks, so we're going to delve a bit deeper in that topic.
</p>

<p>
    FOSDEM 2021 Online will happen through <a href="https://fosdem.org/2021/schedule">fosdem.org/2021/schedule</a>, our main website. Each talk
    is in a room, and each room maps to a virtual room on <a href="https://chat.fosdem.org"><i>chat.fosdem.org</i></a>, combining <a href="page:practical/online#talks">video and
    Q&A</a>.
</p>
<p>
    We'll add a link to each room, but the virtual room name is the same as the room name minus the bit before the dot. So you can find the <i>M.misc</i>
    room at <a href="https://chat.fosdem.org/#/room/#misc:fosdem.org">chat.fosdem.org/#/room/#misc:fosdem.org</a>. You do not need an account to
    view the talks in the virtual room.

    Find more details on the <a href="page:practical/online#talks">practical information page</a> and we hope to see you this weekend!
