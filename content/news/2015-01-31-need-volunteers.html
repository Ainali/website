  We would really like some more volunteers, particularly for crowd control and
  infodesk duty (selling t-shirts, being helpful, etc).

  If you have some spare energy, the FOSDEM team would really appreciate some
  more volunteers to help out particularly with crowd control and selling
  t-shirts at the infodesk.

<p>
  Please report to the infodesk in the K building (ask for Koert!) to claim a
  bright orange t-shirt and help us make FOSDEM even better!
