title: 'Video work almost finished'
---

<p>Almost all of the video recordings from FOSDEM 2017 have
been cut, transcoded, and released.</p>
---MORE---
<p>There are a handful of talks left to fix up, which will happen no later than
next weekend. The weekend after that, we plan to shut down this year's
video-processing infrastructure, unless something important pops up.</p>
<p>Videos are linked from the individual schedule pages for the talks and the
<a href="page:/schedule/events">full schedule</a> page.  They are mirrored from
<a href="http://video.fosdem.org/2017/">video.fosdem.org</a>.</p>
<p>While all videos have been reviewed by a human before they were
released, it remains possible that one or more issues fell through the
cracks. Therefore, if you notice any issues with any video you care
about, now is the time to tell us. Once the infrastructure has been shut
down, fixing issues will no longer be possible.</p>
<p>To report any issues, you can contact us via:</p>
<ul><li>IRC: #fosdem-video on freenode</li>
<li>email: <a href='mailto:video@fosdem.org?subject=recording issues'>video@fosdem.org</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Thank you to all the volunteers, devroom managers, speakers and video
team members who helped recording and reviewing, and who made this
possible.</p>
