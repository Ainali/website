<p>
  FOSDEM offers open source and free software developers a place to
  meet, share ideas and collaborate.  Renowned for being highly
  developer-oriented, the event brings together some 8000+ geeks from
  all over the world.
</p>

<p>
  The twenty-first edition will take place Saturday 6th and Sunday 7th
  February 2021, online.  We will be running a variety of streams 
  including Developer Rooms, Main Tracks and Lightning Talks.
</p>

<h3>Proposals</h3>
<p>
  All proposals for presentations should be submitted using Pentabarf: <a
href="https://fosdem.org/submit">https://fosdem.org/submit</a>.
  If you already created an account in the system for a previous edition,
  please reuse it rather than re-registering. You can reset your password here:
  <a href="https://penta.fosdem.org/user/forgot_password">https://penta.fosdem.org/user/forgot_password</a>
</p>

<p>
  When making a proposal, please select the appropriate track.

  If the topic fits into a Developer Room, then 
  please refer to that room's call for papers, listed 
  <a
href="https://fosdem.org/2021/news/2020-12-06-accepted-developer-rooms">here</a>
  and select that room as the "track". 
  Select <b>Lightning Talks</b> for a 15-minute Lightning Talk outside the 
developer rooms or 
  <b>Main Tracks and Other Topics</b> for everything else.
</p>

<h3>Deadlines</h3>
<p>
  Submission deadlines vary according to the track.
</p>

<p>
  For Developer Rooms, check the relevant 
  <a
href="https://fosdem.org/2021/news/2020-12-06-accepted-developer-rooms">
Call for Papers.</a>.
  The final deadline for Main Track and Other Topics and Lightning Talks
  is 25th December.  
  Accepted speakers will be notified by 31st December
</p>

<p>
  <em>
  Given the condensed timescale this year, please note
  that some programme committees may be reviewing proposals and making
  decisions on an ongoing basis before the published deadlines.  This
  means that, for the most popular tracks, submitting early may
  increase your chance of acceptance as later submissions may be
  competing for fewer remaining places in the schedule, and particular themes 
  for sections of the programme might already have been chosen based upon the
  range of submissions received earlier.
  </em>
</p>

<h3>Requirements</h3>
<p>
  Accepted speakers will need to prepare,
  record and upload their presentation during the first two weeks of
  January.  Guidance will be provided.  Speakers will need to be in 
  a place with a computer with a reliable internet connection and camera
  and microphone when their talk is scheduled so they can join a video
  room and take questions and engage in discussion after their
pre-recorded presentation is played.
</p>

<p>
  The conference language is English. All content must relate to Free
  and Open Source Software. By participating in the event you agree to
  the publication of your recordings, slides and other content provided
  under the same licence as all FOSDEM content (CC-BY).
