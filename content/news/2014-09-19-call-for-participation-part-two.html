</p>

---MORE---

<p>
  There is still time to submit main track presentations. The deadline
  for proposing developer rooms has now passed. Please see our 
  <a href="https://fosdem.org/2015/news/2014-07-01-call-for-participation/">
  previous call for participation</a> for more information on submitting main
  track proposals.
</p>

<b>Lightning talks</b>

<p>
  Lighting talks are short &mdash; 15 minutes &mdash; talks on a wide variety of topics. 
  Anyone who has something interesting to say about an open source topic
  can apply. We particularly encourage topics that do not fit in any of the
  developer rooms.
</p>

<p>
  Proposals for lightning talks should be submitted using Pentabarf:

  </a>

  Please be sure to select "lightning talks" in the "track" field.

  <b>Stands</b>
</p>

<p>
  FOSDEM offers open source projects the opportunity to display their work
  during the event. At their stand, a project can share information, demo
  software, sell merchandise, give away goodies, and so on, and personally
  interact with the visitors.
</p>

<p>  
  What we offer:
</p>

<p>
  <ul>
    <li>one 180x80cm table, positioned in one of the buildings with developer
        rooms, for the entire duration of the conference. In some cases, a
        second table may be possible, if you have a good reason to need two.<li>
    <li>two chairs per table</li>
    <li>one power socket type C/E (if you require adapters or additional
        sockets, please bring them yourself)</li>
    <li>fast uplink shared wireless Internet access</li>
  </ul>
</p>

<p>
  Further practical considerations:
</p>

<p>
  <ul>
    <li>The offer for stands is open to open source projects and 
        communities</li>
    <li>There is no cost or fee for the stands</li>
    <li>The stand should be occupied by at least two people for the duration of
        the conference.</li>
  </ul>
</p>
