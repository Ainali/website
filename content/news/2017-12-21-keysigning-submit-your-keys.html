<p>
  The annual PGP keysigning event at FOSDEM is one of the largest of its
  kind. With more than one hundred participants every year, it is an
  excellent opportunity to strengthen the web of trust.
  For instructions on how to participate in this event, see the
  <a href="/2018/keysigning/">keysigning page</a>.
</p>

<p>
  Key submissions on Wednesday 24 January, to give us
  some time to generate and distribute the list of participants.
  Remember to bring a printed copy of this list to FOSDEM.
