title: First videos already live!
---

<p>Our video recording and transcoding pipeline has been streamlined
over the past few years; the first video to be released this year was
available for viewers yesterday in the afternoon.</p>

---MORE---

<p>As of this writing, there are 54 videos already released to our <a
href='https://video.fosdem.org/2018'>video site</a>, linked to from the
various talks in the <a href='/2018/schedule'>schedule</a>, and (for
those who prefer it) also available on our <a
href='https://youtube.com/fosdemtalks'>YouTube channel</a>. For an
overview of what's available, what's on the way, and what still needs to
be done, please see the <a
href='https://review.video.fosdem.org/overview'>overview page of our
review infrastructure</a>.</p>

<p>If you are a speaker and did a talk on saturday, please help us
stress-test our review infrastructure by reviewing your talk ASAP! As an
added bonus, that also releases your talk to the viewing public so much
sooner. If there's a particular talk that has been recorded but which is
not public yet, please do not hesitate to ask the speaker to review it
as soon as possible.</p>
