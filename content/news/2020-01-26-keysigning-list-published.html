<p>
  The annual PGP keysigning event at FOSDEM is one of the largest of its
  kind. With more than one hundred participants every year, it is an
  excellent opportunity to strengthen the web of trust.
</p>

<p>
  If you are participating in the PGP keysigning, you must now:

  <ul>
  <li>Download the list of keys;
  <li>Verify that your key fingerprint is correct;
  <li>Optionally, verify the integrity of the file using the detached signature;
  <li>Print the list of keys on paper;
  <li>Calculate the checksums, as detailed in the list, and fill them in on the designated spots.
  </ul>
</p>

<p>
  If you do not have your own list of keys with your own checksums, you will not be able to participate in the keysigning party! Remember to bring this list, a pen and your ID to the event on Sunday.
