  FOSDEM isn't finished yet, but the first videos are already being
  transcoded and uploaded to our <a

---MORE---
<p>As of this writing, 43 videos have been released, with 7 more being
transcoded. Speakers who had a talk on Saturday <em>should</em> have
received an invitation by email to review their talks on our <a
href='https://review.video.fosdem.org/'>review system</a>; if you had a
talk yesterday and haven't checked your email yet, please do so that we
can release videos as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Those interested in the state of a particular talk can check out the
<a href='https://review.video.fosdem.org/overview'>overview page</a> for
up-to-date information.</p>
