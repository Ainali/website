<p>
    FOSDEM 2021 is only in several hours, so now is the time to check the <a href="page:schedule">schedule</a> and mark all talks and stands
    that interest you! For a preview of how everything looks and works, go to the <a href="page:live">virtual conference floor</a> and click
    on any of the links (they all work!).

<p>
    Talks and stands can be found on the <a href="page:schedule">schedule</a> (look for the <a href="page:schedule/buildings#s">S</a> building to
    find the stands). All of them will have several links to a live stream (called <i>Video only</i>), a live stream with the Q&A visible
    (called <i>Video with Q&A</i>) and a dedicated chatroom (called <i>Join the conversation!</i>). Stands will also have a link to visit
    their stand (called <i>Visit the stand</i>). Click on any of the links to see what is going on!
</p>
<p>
    Chatting and Q&A is done with <a href="page:practical/online#q_and_a">Matrix</a> (allthough other networks are available) via
    <a href="https://chat.fosdem.org"><i>chat.fosdem.org</i></a>. Now is a very good time to test it out so you are sure that
    everything works during FOSDEM so you won't miss any of the fun!

    Find more details on the <a href="page:practical/online">practical information page</a> and we hope to see you this weekend!
