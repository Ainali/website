title: 'T-shirts and hoodies available!'
---
<p>
    An important part of our programme: the T-shirts and hoodies. They are (again) available, and contrary to normal practices,
    you won't have to stand in line to get them and they won't run out!

<p>
   For the online edition, we partnered with an print-on-demand provider, which means that they won't run out at Saturday noon,
   as they normally do.
