title: Friday Beer Event

<p>The beer event will happen at the usual place, Delirium Cafe, from 18:00(ish) onwards. Come join your fellow hackers for a drink!</p>

<p>Arriving early is advised; the venue fills up quickly. If Delirium is full, please try the other bars in the side street, they take tokens as well.</p>

<p>Speaking of tokens: Buy beer tokens at the ground floor of Delirium for â‚¬3 each. Exact change and buying in increments of 5 or 10 would be highly appreciated! If you are in a group, pool your money and have one person buy for all of you. This saves time for both you and us.</p>

<p>See you there!</p>

<p>PS. Drink wisely, Belgian beers are stronger than you might be used too :)</p>
