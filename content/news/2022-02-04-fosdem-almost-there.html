<p>
    FOSDEM 2022, our second fully virtual conference, is only several hours away. Now would be an excellent time to
    check our <a href="page:schedule">full schedule</a> and mark down all talks that interest you! To get a preview
    of how everything looks and works, visit our <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#fosdem2022:fosdem.org?web-instance[element.io]=chat.fosdem.org">
    FOSDEM 2022 Matrix space</a>
    and look around! You can also visit our <a href="page:live">virtual conference floor</a> to see all the talks
    and stands.

<p>
    Talks and stands can be found on the <a href="page:schedule">schedule</a> (look for the <a href="page:schedule/buildings#s">S</a> building to
    find the stands). All of them will have several links to a live stream (called <i>Video only</i>), a live stream with the Q&A visible
    (called <i>Video with Q&A</i>) and a dedicated chatroom (called <i>Join the conversation!</i>). Stands will also have a link to visit
    their stand (called <i>Visit the stand</i>). Click on any of the links to see what is going on!
</p>
<p>
    Chatting and Q&A is done with <a href="page:practical/online#q_and_a">Matrix</a> (other networks are available) via
    <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#fosdem2022:fosdem.org?web-instance[element.io]=chat.fosdem.org"><i>the FOSDEM 2022 Matrix space</i></a>.
    Now is a very good time to test it out so you are sure that everything works during FOSDEM so you won't miss any of the fun!

    Find more details on the <a href="page:practical/online">practical information page</a> and we hope to see you this weekend!
