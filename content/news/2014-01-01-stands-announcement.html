<p>
  After overwhelming response to our call for participation, we can now announce
  the 45 stands in the AW and K buildings at FOSDEM 2014.

<p>
  FOSDEM offers open source projects the opportunity to display their work
  during the event. At their stand, a project can share information, demo
  software, sell merchandise, give away goodies, and so on, and personally
  interact with the visitors.
</p>

<p>
  The <a href="page:/stands/">list of accepted stands</a> is now available.
</p>

<p>
  In addition to these, Oâ€™Reilly will again be selling a wide variety of books
  at their usual location in the H building.  There will also be room for
  announcements and job offers as in previous years.
