<p>
  FOSDEM offers open source and free software developers a place to
  meet, share ideas and collaborate.  Renowned for being highly
  developer-oriented, the event brings together some 8000+ geeks from
  all over the world.
</p>

<p>
  The twenty-second edition will take place online on Saturday 5th and 
  Sunday 6th February 2022 using the same underlying technology as the 
  twenty-first edition.
  We will be running a variety of streams including Developer Rooms, Main
  Tracks and Lightning Talks.
</p>

<h3>Proposals</h3>
<p>
  All proposals for presentations should be submitted using Pentabarf: <a
href="https://fosdem.org/submit">https://fosdem.org/submit</a>.
  If you already created an account in the system for a previous edition,
  please reuse it rather than re-registering. You can reset your password here:
  <a href="https://penta.fosdem.org/user/forgot_password">https://penta.fosdem.org/user/forgot_password</a>
</p>

<p>
  When making a proposal, please select the appropriate track.
</p>

<p>
If the topic fits into a <b>Developer Room</b>, then 
  please refer to that room's call for papers, listed 
  <a
href="page:news/2021-11-30-accepted-developer-rooms">here</a>
  and select that room as the "track". 
</p>

<p>
  Select <b>Lightning Talks</b> for a 15-minute Lightning Talk outside the 
developer rooms.  
</p>

<p>
For the main tracks, please choose from the following topics:
<b>Community (Main Tracks)</b>,
<b>Real Time Communications (Main Tracks)</b>,
<b>Security (Main Tracks)</b> or,
alternatively, pick <b>Other Topics (Main Tracks and Keynotes)</b> for anything
that doesn't fit into any of the other categorisations.
</p>

<p>
Main track presentations will be allocated slots of either 45 or 60 minutes,
which includes some time for live Q&amp;A after the video presentation. 
Please set the Duration field to one of those two values.
Your pre-recording should then be between 5 and 10 minutes shorter 
than the duration you chose.
</p>

<h3>Deadlines</h3>
<p>
  Submission deadlines vary according to the track.
</p>

<p>
  For Developer Rooms, check the relevant 
  <a
href="page:news/2021-11-30-accepted-developer-rooms">
Call for Papers</a>.
  The final deadline for Main Tracks and Lightning Talks
  is <b>Tuesday 28th December 2021</b>.
  Accepted speakers will be notified by <b>Tuesday 4th January 2022</b>.
</p>

<p>
  <em>
  Please note
  that some programme committees may be reviewing proposals and making
  decisions on an ongoing basis before the published deadlines.  This
  means that, for the most popular tracks, submitting early may
  increase your chance of acceptance as later submissions may be
  competing for fewer remaining places in the schedule, and particular themes 
  for sections of the programme might already have been chosen based upon the
  range of submissions received earlier.
  </em>
</p>

<h3>Requirements</h3>
<p>
  Accepted speakers will need to prepare,
  record and upload their presentation during the first three weeks of
  January, no later than <b>Friday 21st January</b>.  Guidance will be provided.  Speakers will need to be in 
  a place with a computer with a reliable internet connection and working camera
  and microphone when their presentation is scheduled so they can join a video
  room and take questions and engage in discussion after their
  pre-recorded presentation is played.
</p>
