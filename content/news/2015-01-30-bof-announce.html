title: BoF rooms and Announcement + Job corner
---

<p>
  Just like previous editions, we will have two freely bookable rooms for open source communities to use (BoF rooms). See below for the details.
</p>
<p>
  There will also be an announcement corner and a job corner again. Any announcement regarding open source software, communities or events around FOSDEM can be put there. At the job corner, you can put job offers assuming they involve open source software (no active flyering/recruiting allowed).

<p>
  The BoF room concept is simple: any project or community can reserve a timeslot
  (fifteen minutes to an hour), during which they have the room just to
  themselves.
</p>

<p>
  These rooms are intended for ad-hoc discussions, meet-ups or brainstorming
  sessions. They are not a replacement for a developer room and they are
  certainly not intended for talks. The rooms are deliberately not equipped
  with projectors. The rooms are small and cosy. There are seats for
  approximately thirty people.
</p>

<p>
  Reservations can be made only during the event and are on a first-come,
  first-served basis. The signup sheets will be at the infodesk in the H
  building, the rooms are in the same building (second floor).
