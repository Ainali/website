<p>
    FOSDEM 2021 is just around the corner, and some of you are probably curious how everything is going to work. After all, in other years
    you simply had to go the ULB, find your room (always a challenge), sit back and enjoy.
</p>
<p>
    But how is that going to work in this virtual event? Read more and find out!

    Like every year, there will be talks, devrooms and stands. While you would normally try to get in a room to see the talk, and watch
    the video only afterwards (or as a substitute because the room was full); this year, the room is virtual (unlimited capacity) and
    the talk is the video.
</p>
<p>
    Thanks to the amazing <a href="https://matrix.org">Matrix people</a>, we're able to create virtual (Matrix) chat rooms combining video
    (the talk) and chat (Q&A and hallroom discussion), so you can watch the talk from the uncrowded environments of your own home, and
    ask questions or discuss the topic with everybody present. The <a href="page:schedule">schedule</a> will have a link to each virtual room,
    so simply follow that and enjoy the experience (you do not need an account to watch a talk).
</p>
<p>
    The stands are not spread out over the campus, but are concentrated on their own <a href="https://stands.fosdem.org">website</a>. You can
    visit them as you normally would, but we wouldn't want you to miss the opportunity to talk to the team behind each project. Therefore, we've
    created a chat room for each stand where you can discuss anything with the team and ask the question you always wanted to ask.

<p>
    We hope to see you next week! Find more details on the <a href="page:schedule">schedule</a> and on the 
    <a href="page:practical/online">practical information page</a>.
