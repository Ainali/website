  Looking for something to do the evening before FOSDEM?
</p>

---MORE---

<p>
  Like every year, many FOSDEM attendees are planning to enjoy some beers at the
  <a href="http://www.deliriumcafe.be/">Delirium Caf&eacute;</a>, in a beautiful
  alley near the
  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Place">Grand Place</a>
  in Brussels.
  We have reserved most of the bar (most of the alley in fact!) again this year.
</p>

<p>
  Come and join us next Friday, 30 January, from 17:00(ish).
</p>

<p>Read the <a href="page:/beerevent">beer event page</a> for all the details!</p>

<p>
  If the beer event is very busy or if you would like dinner before heading over
  (Delirium Caf√© does not serve food), a number of other events are on.  These
  are just the ones we know about (check the <a
    href="https://lists.fosdem.org/mailman/listinfo/fosdem">fosdem@ mailing
  list</a> for more announcements):
</p>

<p>
  So far:
  <ul>
    <li>The Software Freedom Conservancy is <a
	  href="http://sfconservancy.org/news/2015/jan/20/supporter-night-2015/">organising
	  a dinner nearby</a> (tickets cheaper when <a
	  href="http://sfconservancy.org/supporter/event.html">bought in advance</a>).
    </li>
  </ul>
</p>

<p>
  Alternatively there are plenty of local restaurants within ten minutes walk of
  the Delirium&mdash;you can't miss them!
</p>

<p>See you there!</p>

<p>PS: Drink wisely.  Belgian beers are stronger than you might be used to. <code>:-)</code>
