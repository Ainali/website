  FOSDEM offers open source developers a place to meet, share ideas and
  collaborate.  Renowned for being highly developer-oriented, the event
  brings together some 5000+ geeks from all over the world.
</p>

<p>
  The fifteenth edition will take place on Saturday 31 January and Sunday 1
  February 2015 at the usual location: ULB Campus Solbosch in Brussels.
</p>

<p>
  We now invite proposals for main track presentations and developer rooms.
</p>

<p>
  Previous editions have featured tracks centered around security,
  operating system development, community building, and many other topics.
  Presentations are expected to be 50 minutes long and should cater to a
  varied technical audience.  The conference covers travel expenses and
  arranges accommodation for accepted main track speakers.
</p>

<p>
  Developer rooms are assigned to self-organising groups to work together
  on open source projects, to discuss topics relevant to a broader subset
  of the community, etc.  Content may be scheduled in any format, subject
  to approval.  Popular formats include presentation tracks, hacking
  sessions and panel discussions.  Proposals involving collaboration
  across project or domain boundaries are strongly encouraged.
</p>

<p>
  Proposals for main track presentations should be submitted using
  Pentabarf:

<p>
  Developer room proposals should be emailed to
  <a href="mailto:devrooms@fosdem.org">devrooms@fosdem.org</a> and
  be as detailed as possible.  In particular, coordinators should indicate
  their affinity with the topic being proposed and provide a rough idea of
  the content they plan to schedule.
