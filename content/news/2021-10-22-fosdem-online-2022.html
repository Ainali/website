<p>
  After several long and passionate debates, we have decided to make FOSDEM an
  online event.
</p>
<p>
  There are a lot of good arguments in favor of physical, hybrid, and online events
  each. We do not wish to rehash all of them in public, so please understand if we
  do not engage in public debates on their relative merits.
</p>
<p>
  This was not an easy decision, but at least it's a decision. Similar to <a
  href="https://events.ccc.de/#rc3-2021-en-version">CCC</a>, we would prefer something
  else, but it is what it is.
</p>
<p>
  On a positive note, we can now plan. Expect a timeline for the usual submissions within
  the next 1-2 weeks.
