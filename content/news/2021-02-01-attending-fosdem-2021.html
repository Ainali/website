<p>
    FOSDEM is in 6 days, so now is a good time to check whether you can visit the conference. We're going to
    walk through all of the bits and pieces so you are fully prepared on Saturday en Sunday between 10am and 6pm CET.

<p>
    FOSDEM 2021 Online will happen through <a href="https://fosdem.org/2021/schedule">fosdem.org/2021/schedule</a>, our main website. Each talk
    is in a room, and each room maps to a virtual room on <a href="https://chat.fosdem.org"><i>chat.fosdem.org</i></a>, combining <a href="page:practical/online#talks">video and
    Q&A</a>.
</p>
<p>
    We'll add a link to each room, but the virtual room name is the same as the room name minus the bit before the dot. So you can find the <i>M.misc</i>
    room at <a href="https://chat.fosdem.org/#/room/#misc:fosdem.org">chat.fosdem.org/#/room/#misc:fosdem.org</a>. You do not need an account to
    view the talks in the virtual room.

    Find more details on the <a href="page:practical/online#talks">practical information page</a> and we hope to see you this weekend!
