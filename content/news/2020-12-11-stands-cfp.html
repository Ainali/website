<p>
  We now invite proposals for stands for FOSDEM 2021.
</p>

---MORE---

<p>
  FOSDEM offers open source and free software developers a place to
  meet, share ideas and collaborate.  Renowned for being highly
  developer-oriented, the event brings together some 8000+ geeks from
  all over the world.
</p>

<p>
  The twenty-first edition will take place Saturday 6th and Sunday 7th
  February 2021, online.
</p>

<p>
  Stands allow projects to showcase their work to interested visitors,
  answer their questions, and in normal years, hand out swag to support
  their project.
</p>

<p>
  For obvious reasons, unfortunately we will be unable to run a physical
  conference in Brussels this year, but we would still like to give 
  communities a place to meet online.
</p>

<p>
    We offer you:
    <ol>
        <li>A position on a special stands website (active during the event) for you to introduce your project. We will organise the stands per theme.</li>
        <li>Hosting for a webpage and several short videos where you can introduce and demonstrate your project and show people the latest features, discuss your roadmap etc.</li>
        <li>A chatroom facility to allow visitors to interact with you. (Details will be confirmed closer to the event.) </li>
    </ol>
</p>

<p>
  Proposals should be submitted through the form at
  <a href="https://stands.fosdem.org/submission">stands.fosdem.org/submission</a>
