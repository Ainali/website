  While there are still a lot of open questions, we are aiming for a physical
  FOSDEM 2023. It's both exciting and scary.

<p>
  We will open Call for Devrooms etc soon. One note: With the online format, we
  were able to host more devrooms than ever. In the physical world, we will be
  constrained by the amount and size of the rooms ULB is able and willing to
  offer us. We will do our best to accommodate the maximum amount of content, but
  we will likely need to be more deliberate in selecting devrooms again.
