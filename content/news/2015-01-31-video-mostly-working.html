title: Recording and streaming mostly working!

<p>
  As pointed out during the opening talk, we have a completely new recording and
  streaming workflow this year.  After some teething problems this morning,
  we're happy to report that most things are now working!

  Unfortunately, we were not able to record or stream the opening presentation
  and the first part of Karen Sandler's <em>Identity Crisis</em> keynote.

<p>
  Our video team and network team are working hard to fix the remaining teething
  problems and we hope to be able to have everything working smoothly in very
  short order.  Please bear with us!
