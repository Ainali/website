title: 'FOSDEM 2023 call for devrooms'
---

<p>
We now invite proposals for developer rooms for FOSDEM 2023.
</p>
---MORE---
<p>
FOSDEM offers open source and free software developers a place to meet, share ideas and collaborate. Renowned for being highly developer-oriented, the event brings together some 8000+ geeks from all over the world.
</p>
<p>
The twenty-third edition will take place <b>Saturday 4th and Sunday 5th February 2023</b> in <b>Brussels, Belgium</b>.
</p>
<p>
Developer rooms are assigned to self-organising groups to work together on open source and free software projects, to discuss topics relevant to a broader subset of the community, etc. Most content should take the form of presentations. Proposals involving collaboration across project or domain boundaries are strongly encouraged.
</p>
<p>
We are happy that we have the opportunity again to run a physical conference in Brussels. However, this also means that we will have less space for parallel tracks. Thats why we are polling devroom organisers to see if they have any interest in a hybrid session, eg with a physical devroom one day and a virtual session the next day, or even if people would prefer an online devroom only. 
</p>
<p>
For virtual devrooms we would use the same Matrix platform as last year. This allows devroom organizers to run the conference primarily using pre-recorded talks with some live content including Q&amp;A sessions and discussion panels, with streaming and archiving. The recordings will be published under the same licence as all FOSDEM content (CC-BY). Note that we might decide not to run a virtual component if there is insufficient interest, we will announce the discussion when
the list of devroom proposals is announced (31 October).
</p>
<p>
Devroom managers must enter a complete schedule into our conference system by 15th December. 
</p>
<p>
Developer room proposals should be submitted through the form at <a href="https://fosdem.org/devroom">https://fosdem.org/devroom</a> which contains further information.</p>
