        <p>FOSDEM is a conference entirely made by volunteers. While a small crew works on it year-round, most of the work during the conference is done by a large, enthusiastic, group of great people who donate one or more hours of their time to make FOSDEM happen - <strong>you</strong>. And this year is no different - we need your help. <a href="https://volunteers.fosdem.org/">Sign up here!</a></p>

        <p>We're looking for volunteers that can take on a wide variety of tasks; from building up the conference to introducing speakers before their talk. Volunteers will be working on Friday,Saturday and Sunday, so even if you don't want to miss anything of the conference, you can still help make it happen on Friday! Volunteering can last for half a day to a couple of hours, and you can take on as many tasks as you want.</p>

        <p>While we can't offer you any compensation, it's called volunteering after all, you'll get an amazing experience, the chance to meet great people and the warm, fuzzy, feeling knowing that you made FOSDEM happen this year. We will also take care of you during your volunteering spell, ensuring that you are mentored and have everything you need while helping out.</p>

        <p>Please go over to <a href="https://volunteers.fosdem.org/">volunteers.fosdem.org</a> to pick your tasks, subscribe to our <a href="https://lists.fosdem.org/listinfo/volunteers">volunteer mailing list</a> to get updated with the latest information. Before and especially during the conference, our <a href="ircs://irc.libera.chat:6697/fosdem-volunteers">IRC channel</a> (<em>#fosdem-volunteers</em>@<a href="https://libera.chat/">Libera.Chat</a>) is the place to go!</p>

        <p>We hope to see you at FOSDEM!</p>
