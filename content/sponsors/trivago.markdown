trivago is a global hotel search platform. We are focused on reshaping
the way travelers search for and compare hotels, while enabling hotel
advertisers to grow their businesses. Our search platform makes sense
of a complex, fragmented web of online hotel offerings in a
comprehensive way, by aggregating information from a deep supply of
hotels and websites. trivago provides access to over 1.8m hotels,
including vacation rentals and alternative accommodations, with prices
and availability from over 400+ booking sites and hotel chains.

trivago is a place where we take pride in learning from one another.
We love what we do but we don’t take ourselves too seriously— we make
mistakes, but the drive to continually improve is something we all
possess.

Our tech stack:
<ul>
<li>Highly modern JavaScript, including Jest, Snapshot
testing, Redux, webpack, Rollup and of course ES6+</li>
<li>PHP and Symfony at their best, running on handmade FreeBSD
servers</li>
<li>node.js in the cloud</li>
<li>Storage systems: Percona MySQL, Cassandra, Redis,

<li>Big Data” areas: Java, Hadoop, Kafka, Stream
