As a key hosting service in Europe for 25 years, Infomaniak is one of the main
developers of web hosting technologies and is the pioneer of ecological hosting.
The company manages two data centres, more than one million e-mail addresses and
400,000 domain names and employs more than 130 members of staff in Switzerland.
Its position at the high end of the market and its location in the heart of
Europe make it a long-standing partner of major media companies and brands,
international institutions and global groups. Infomaniak recently launched
[SwissTransfer.com](https://swisstransfer.com/), an advertising-free alternative
to WeTransfer that allows you to share up to 50 GB for free. The hosting company
will soon be offering a complete alternative to Gmail and Dropbox, developed and
hosted entirely in Switzerland.
