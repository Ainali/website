Designed and developed in France, Qwant is the first European search
engine with its own indexing technology, which protects the privacy of
its users by refusing all tracking devices, including for advertising.
Contrary to the main search engines on the market, Qwant does not
install cookies on the user browser, does not want to know who the
user is or what he/she does, and does not keep individual logs of user
queries.

Qwantâ€™s friendly interface allows users to find answers efficiently
from the Web and social networks. It respects neutrality. Qwant
considers all indexed websites and services with no discrimination,
without altering the ranking of results according to its own
interests.

Founded in 2013 by Eric Leandri, Jean-Manuel Rozan, Alberto Chalon and
the Pertimm company, Qwant SAS has offices in Paris, Nice, Rouen,
Ajaccio, Milan and Berlin.
