The Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) will harmonize emerging
technologies and foster innovation in container packaged, dynamically
scheduled, and microservices based application development and operations.
The mission of the CNCF is to create and drive the adoption of a new
computing paradigm that is optimized for modern distributed systems
environments capable of scaling to tens of thousands of self healing
multi-tenant nodes.

The Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) supports the event financially.
