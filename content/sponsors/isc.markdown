ISC is a non-profit that develops software and offers services in
support of the Internet infrastructure. We believe that open source
protects the Internet from being overtaken by businesses or
governments who may not have the world’s interests at heart. It is
essential for individuals and organizations to have open source
options for their critical Internet functions.

ISC develops and distributes three open source Internet networking
software packages: BIND 9, ISC DHCP, and Kea DHCP. In addition to our
open source software, ISC also operates critical Internet
infrastructure in the form of the F-Root server, one of the 13
Internet root name servers that power the global Internet. ISC’s work
is supported by the sale of software support contracts, keeping us
focused on the needs of our users.

ISC supports the event financially.
