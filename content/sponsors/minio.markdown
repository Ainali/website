Minio is a distributed object storage server. It is written in Go and
released under Apache License 2.0. The name Minio stems from Minimal
Object storage.

Minio will enable application developers to build their own Amazon S3
compatible object storage without any special storage skills. It is
light enough to be bundled along with the application stack similar to
Node.js and MongoDB.

Our community hangs out on Gitter @ [http://gitter.minio.io/](http://gitter.minio.io/).

Minio supports the event financially.
