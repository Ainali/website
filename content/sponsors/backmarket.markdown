Founded in 2014, Back Market is the number one European marketplace
(soon to be worldwide!) exclusively dedicated to give electronic
products a second life.

Our mission is simple: build a consumer alternative to the purchase of
new electrical and electronic devices. And work against planned
obsolescence and the exponential production of electronic waste.

As a growing tech company, most of our product relies on open source
technologies and tools (Django, Vue.js, Go and many more). For us,
promoting and contributing back to an open source community is one
step closer to our ideal of society.

Back Market supports the event financially.
