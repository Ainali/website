Founded in 2014 in France, Back Market is the world's first 
online marketplace dedicated exclusively to second-hand devices. 

We provide a platform that allows the consumer to enjoy 
a shopping experience with the associated advantages one 
has when buying new, but at a cheaper price. 
It also enables the merchants to market their product in the fastest and most efficient manner. By bringing range, transparency and quality standards to the industry.


Spurred into action by the megatons of e-waste we produce each year 
thanks to our collective obsession with new tech, Back Market is 
challenging people to rethink their tech consumption.  
And our team continues to grow.. We have over 600 people in New York, Prague, Paris, Bordeaux, Berlin, Barcelona and remote.   
We have a Culture Team ensuring "work" is a fun place to be, and a D&I team ensuring everyone feels included and heard.

As a growing tech company, most of our products rely on open source technologies 
and tools (Django, Vue.js, Go and many more). 
For us, promoting and contributing back to an open source community is one step closer to our ideal of society.

Back Market supports the event financially.
