<h3>FOSDEM 2021 is the first fully online edition of FOSDEM!</h3>
<p>
    Welcome to our first online edition. We still have our familiar programme of keynotes, devrooms and stands, but in a slightly different
    form. We have collected useful information on how to navigate this brave new world.

<h4>Keynotes and talks</h4>
<p>
    The full conference can be accessed from the <a href="page:schedule">schedule</a>, containing a link to each
    individual talk or devroom. Each devroom is in a (virtual) room, which you can access by clicking the link. All rooms are hosted on <i>chat.fosdem.org</i>.

<i id="virtual-room-view">Virtual room view. 1 is the video window; 2 is the chat window.</i>
<p>
    The virtual room is where the action happens. Each room is divided in two parts:
    <ol>
        <li>
            The video window, where the stream will be displayed. This will be a combination of a prerecorded video (the talk) and a live
            recording of the Q&A.            
        </li>
        <li>
            The chat window. You can freely chat (but please keept it relevant and remember our <a href="page:practical/conduct">code of conduct</a>).
            If you find a question very relevant or insightful, you can upvote it by clicking the <i>thumbs up</i> button. The most upvoted questions will
            be asked during the Q&A at the end of each talk.
        </li>
    </ol>
</p>
<p>
    It is not necessary to register to watch video's, but you will need an account to post or upvote questions.
