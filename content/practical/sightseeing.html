<p>
  Starting in 2009, FOSDEM has hired professional guides each year to offer free
  guided tours of Brussels to the spouses/partners of FOSDEM visitors.
  If your partner would like to accompany you to Brussels but is not interested
  in the FOSDEM conference, this will make their stay worthwhile.
  Brussels has a rich historical past and a cosmopolitan present.
</p>

<p>
  The <em>free tours</em> will take place on both afternoons of the conference.
  Each tour will give you a view of a different part of the city, and the tours
  offered this year will be different from those offered in previous years.
  The meeting point is at the infodesk in the H building, and the tours end there as well.

<h2>Destinations</h2>

<p>
   <b>Saturday:</b>
   A tram ride to the centre of Brussels followed by a guided tour in the
   historic city centre, not only looking at the highlights, such as the Grote
   Markt, Manneken Pis, the Sint-Hubertusgalerijen etc..., but moreover
   explaining how the city of Brussels markets the city centre as ‘mediaeval’ and
   does everything not to shock the tourist with modern buildings.  This results
   in a series of new buildings with old fashioned façades. During the tour, the
   guide will try to let you look through the façades and show you the modern city.
</p>

<p>
  <b>Sunday:</b>
  A walk in the neighbourhood of FOSDEM, Ter Kameren, the ponds and Flagey, with
  time for a coffee break.  A stone's throw from the ULB campus
  lies the Place Flagey.  This lively square, with the Flagey building in Art
  Deco on the edge, has had a revival since its redesign. People come from all
  over the city to watch and be watched from the terrace of Café Belga.  The
  road to it is very nice too, along Cambre Abbey, with the idyllic sources of
  Maelbeek, along the Ixelles ponds, surrounded by beautiful villas and the
  streets around the Place Flagey, still marked by the Portuguese migration
