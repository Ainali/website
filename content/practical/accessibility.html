<p>
  FOSDEM welcomes all free software and open source developers!  While
  we don't own the university campus and have little control over its
  accessibility, we have tried to find ways for developers with
  physical limitations to make the most of the event.
</p>

<h3>Visual or auditory needs</h3>

<p>
  For people with visual or auditory needs, marked places near the
  speaker are available in the following rooms:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>H.2215 (Ferrer)</li>
  <li>Janson</li>
  <li>K.1.105 (La Fontaine)</li>
  <li>UA2.220 (Guilissen)</li>
  <li>UB2.252A (Lameere)</li>
  <li>UD2.120 (Chavanne)</li>
  <li>UD2.218A</li>
</ul>

<h3>Wheelchair and limited mobility needs</h3>

<p>
  There is a limited number of
  <a href="https://www.ulb.ac.be/mobilite/stationnement-PMR.html#solbosch">reserved car park spaces</a>
  available.
</p>

<p>
  All signposted routes between buildings are step-free, unless indicated otherwise (with a set of steps). If the route is not step-free, there will be an accessible route nearby, indicated with signs (look for the elevator or wheelchair signs).
</p>
<ul>
  <li>To get to <b>Janson</b>, you must go via <b>H</b>.</li>
  <li>To get from <b>K</b> to the rest of the campus (and vice versa), use the <b>F</b> building. A lift and a stair lift will help you bridge the height difference, just follow the signs.</li>
</ul>

<p>
  Almost all rooms can be accessed without stairs, except for some devrooms in AW:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>AW1.121</li>
  <li>AW1.125</li>
</ul>

<p>
  We film all talks, so if you wish to follow what is going on in both rooms, make your way to one of the hacker rooms (H building), whip out the headphones and head to <a href="https://video.fosdem.org">video.fosdem.org</a>.
</p>
<p>
  All other rooms and buildings can be accessed without the use of stairs, allthough sometimes a little detour might be needed. We'll put up signs to make sure you do not get lost. This holds especially for the following locations.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>The main route via the car park to Janson is not step free. For step free access, go to the first floor of the H building and follow the signs to Janson.</li>
  <li>The rooms in UD cannot be accessed from the main entrance in the garden. Use the entrance on Avenue Paul HÃ©ger and go to the second floor with the elevator.</li>
  <li>To get to UA, enter via UB, take the elevator to the first floor and follow the signs until you reach another elevator. Go to the second floor for UA.</li>
  <li>You enter UB on the second floor via the garden. To go to other floors, use the lift and follow the signs to FOSDEM.</li>
</ul>

<p>
  At <a href="https://nav.fosdem.org">nav.fosdem.org</a>, you will
  find our on-campus route planner. It has an option for avoiding
  stairs. All routes calculated with this option set should be
  wheelchair and limited mobility accessible.
</p>


<h3>Accessibility contact</h3>

<p>
  All FOSDEM staff members (yellow shirts) and volunteers (orange
  shirts) should be able to help you find accessible routes around the
  campus.
