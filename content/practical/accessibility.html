<p>
  FOSDEM welcomes all free software and open source developers!  While we don't own the university
  campus and have little control over its accessibility, we have tried to find
  ways for developers with physical limitations to make the most of the event.
</p>
<h3>Visual or auditory needs</h3>

<p>For people with visual or auditory needs, marked places near the
speaker are available in the following rooms:</p>

<ul>
 <li>H.2215 (Ferrer)</li>
 <li>UA2.220 (Guilissen)</li>
 <li>UB2.252A (Lameere)</li>
 <li>UD2.120 (Chavanne)</li>
 <li>UD2.218A</li<
 <li>Janson</li>
 <li>K.1.105 (La Fontaine)</li>
</ul>

<p>People with auditory needs might want to know that for FOSDEM 2018, we are also running an experiment with closed captioning of a limited subset of video recordings. These captioned videos will be made available in the weeks after the event.</p>

<h3>Wheelchair and limited mobility needs</h3>

<p><a href="https://nav.fosdem.org">Nav.fosdem.org</a> is our on campus route planner. It has an option for avoiding stairs. All routes calculated this way should be wheelchair and limited mobility accessible. Rooms with no limited mobility access are AW1121 and 1W1125.</p>

<h3>Accessibility contact</h3>
<p>
All staff and volunteers should be able to help you find accessible routes around the campus.
</p>
