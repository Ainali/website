<p>
  FOSDEM welcomes all open source developers!  While we don't own the university
  campus and have little control over its accessibility, we have tried to find
  ways for developers with physical limitations to make the most of the event.
</p>

<h3>Accessibility contact</h3>
<p>
  All staff and volunteers should be able to help you find accessible routes
  around the campus.
</p>
<p>
  Mark van den Borre is particularly familiar with the campus.
  You can contact him directly during the event by email (<a
  href="mailto:mvandenborre@fosdem.org">mvandenborre@fosdem.org</a>) or phone
  (+32 486 961 726).
  You can also ask any volunteer or staff member to radio him.
</p>

We welcome any suggestions to further improve the accessibility of FOSDEM.
Please contact Mark if you have any suggestions or concerns.
