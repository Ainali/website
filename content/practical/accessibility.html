<p>
  FOSDEM welcomes all free software and open source developers!  While
  we don't own the university campus and have little control over its
  accessibility, we have tried to find ways for developers with
  physical limitations to make the most of the event.
</p>

<h3>Visual or auditory needs</h3>

<p>
  For people with visual or auditory needs, marked places near the
  speaker are available in the following rooms:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>H.2215 (Ferrer)</li>
  <li>Janson</li>
  <li>K.1.105 (La Fontaine)</li>
  <li>UA2.220 (Guilissen)</li>
  <li>UB2.252A (Lameere)</li>
  <li>UD2.120 (Chavanne)</li>
  <li>UD2.218A</li>
</ul>

<h3>Wheelchair and limited mobility needs</h3>

<p>
  There is a limited number of
  <a href="https://www.ulb.ac.be/mobilite/stationnement-PMR.html#solbosch">reserved car park spaces</a>
  available.
</p>

<p>
  At <a href="https://nav.fosdem.org">nav.fosdem.org</a>, you will
  find our on-campus route planner. It has an option for avoiding
  stairs. All routes calculated with this option set should be
  wheelchair and limited mobility accessible.
</p>

<p>
  Unfortunately, some rooms are only accessible by using stairs:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>AW1.121</li>
  <li>AW1.125</li>
  <li>UA2.114 (Baudoux)</li>
  <li>UA2.118 (Henriot)</li>
  <li>UA2.220 (Guillissen)</li>
</ul>

<p>
  If you understand French, the <a href="https://www.ulb.ac.be/mobilite/PMR-acces.html">ULB's website</a>
  may be a useful source of additional information.
<P>

<h3>Accessibility contact</h3>

<p>
  All FOSDEM staff members (yellow shirts) and volunteers (orange
  shirts) should be able to help you find accessible routes around the
  campus.
</p>

<h3>Suggestions welcome</h3>
