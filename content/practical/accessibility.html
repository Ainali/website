<p>
  FOSDEM welcomes all open source developers!  While we don't own the university
  campus and have little control over its accessibility, we have tried to find
  ways for developers with physical limitations to make the most of the event.
</p>

<h3>Wheelchair users</h3>
<p>
  All rooms except for <a href="<%= pathof '/schedule/room/aw1121/'
  %>">AW1.121</a> and <a href="<%= pathof '/schedule/room/aw1125/'
  %>">AW1.125</a> are accessible to wheelchair users.
  There are ramps and lifts.
  The accessible routes and the location of the lifts are not always obvious but
  FOSDEM staff and volunteers will be happy to show you around.
</p>

<h3>Developers with limited hearing or vision</h3>
<p>
  We reserve a limited number of seats at the front of both main track rooms
  (Janson and K.1.105 (La Fontaine)) for developers with hearing or visual
  impairments.
  We cannot make advance reservations in every developer room, but
  accommodations can usually be made on the spot.
</p>

<h3>Accessibility contact</h3>
<p>
  All staff and volunteers should be able to help you find accessible routes
  around the campus.
</p>
<p>
  Mark van den Borre is particularly familiar with the campus.
  You can contact him directly during the event by email (<a
  href="mailto:mvandenborre@fosdem.org">mvandenborre@fosdem.org</a>) or phone
  (+32 486 961 726).
  You can also ask any volunteer or staff member to radio him.
</p>

We welcome any suggestions to further improve the accessibility of FOSDEM.
Please contact Mark if you have any suggestions or concerns.
