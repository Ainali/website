<p>
  The annual keysigning event at <%= conference()[:title] %> is one of the
  largest of its kind.  With more than one hundred participants every year, it
  is an excellent opportunity to strengthen the web of trust.  We use a
  slightly modified version of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zimmermann%E2%80%93Sassaman_key-signing_protocol">
    Zimmermann-Sassaman key-signing protocol</a> relying on a key submission
  server rather than email to collect keys.
</p>

<h3>Before the event</h3>
<h4>Submit your keys</h4>

<p>
  <% if conf.fetch(:submission_notyet) %>
	  <span class="label label-info">
	    Submissions are not yet accepted.
	  </span>
  <% elsif conf.fetch(:submission_closed) %>
	  <span class="label label-info">
	    The submission deadline has passed.
	  </span>
  <% end %>
</p>

<p>
  If you intend to participate in the PGP keysigning event at
  <%= conference()[:title] %>, you must submit the keys you would like to have
  signed to the keyserver listening on <code>ksp.fosdem.org</code>.  If you
  are using GnuPG, this can easily be accomplished with:
</p>
<pre class="sh">
gpg --keyserver ksp.fosdem.org --send-key [keyid]
</pre>

<p>
  If you have multiple keys, try to (re)submit them together. Since the list is
  sorted by (re)submission time, this will group your keys on the list, saving
  everyone a lot of browsing forward and backward through the list.
</p>

<p>
  You may want to verify that your submission made it to the keyserver by
  checking the list of submitted keys at <a
  href="https://ksp.fosdem.org/">https://ksp.fosdem.org/</a>.
</p>

<% unless conf.fetch(:submission_notyet) %>
	<p>
	  The deadline for submissions is <strong>
	  <%= conf.fetch(:submission_deadline).strftime(dateformat) %></strong>.
	  After this date, the keyserver will no longer accept submissions and the
	  official keylist will be published.
	</p>
<% end %>


<h4>Download the list of participants</h4>
<% unless conf.fetch(:list_published) %>
	<p>
	  <span class="label label-info">
	    The list of participants has not yet been published!
	  </span>
	</p>
<% end %>

<p>
  If you are participating in the keysigning event (i.e.: you have submitted
  your key to the keyserver), you should download the final list of
  participants and follow its instructions closely. Said instructions are at the  begining of the file. 
</p>

<p>
  <% if conf.fetch(:list_published) %>
	The final list of participants is available from
  <% else %>
	The final list of participants will be available from
  <% end %>
  <a href="https://ksp.fosdem.org/files/">https://ksp.fosdem.org/files/</a>.
</p>

<p>
  If there is a trust-path between you and the author, you should verify the
  list's detached signature using:
</p>
<pre class="sh">
gpg --verify ksp-<%= klist %>.txt.asc ksp-<%= klist %>.txt
</pre>

<p>
  Besides the official list, <code>ksp-<%= klist %>.txt</code>, we also provide
  non-authoritative files that may make your life easier.  It is up to you, the
  participant, to verify that these files actually contain the same information
  than the official list: e.g. for the <code>keyring.gpg</code> file,
  you could run the <code>keylist.txt.sh</code> script and verify that
  the output similar enough to the official list.  Note that different
  GnuPG version may output slightly different output.  In particular,
  GnuPG older than version 2.1 uses
  <a href="https://www.gnupg.org/faq/whats-new-in-2.1.html#keylist">a different key format</a>.
</p>


<h3>The key signing event itself</h3>

<p>
  The keysigning event takes place on Sunday, at 14:00, in the corridor on the
  second level of the U building.  There is no fixed end time.  Previous
  editions last for approximately one hour per 100 keys on the list.
  To participate, you should have submitted your keys before the deadline.
  Please bring the <strong>printed list</strong>, a <strong>pen</strong>
  and appropriate form of <strong>identification</strong> with you to
  <%= conference()[:title] %>.
  Note that it is <strong>not possible to print</strong> the list at the conference.
</p>

<p>
  You may find it useful to make a badge stating the number(s) of your key(s)
  on this list and the fact that you verified the fingerprints of your own
  key(s).  Also provide a place to mark that your hashes match.  Be on time to
  actually verify the hashes as they are announced!  e.g.
</p>
<pre class="sh">
I am number 001
My key-id &amp; fingerprint: ☑
The hashes:              ☐
</pre>

<p>
  To avoid descending into chaos, the organiser will line up the participants
  in the order of the list.
</p>
<pre class="sh">
  1 - 2 - 3 - 4 - 5 - 6 - 7 - 8
</pre>
<p>
  Next, this line folds onto itself, so everyone is facing another participant.
</p>
<pre class="sh">
  1 - 2 - 3 - 4
  8 - 7 - 6 - 5
</pre>
<p>
  After the participants have verified each other's identity, <strong>the whole line
  moves one step to their right</strong>.  Participants on the end of the line move to
  the opposite line.  That way, everyone should be facing the next person on
  their list (modulo no-shows).
</p>
<pre class="sh">
      2 - 3 - 4 - 5
  1 - 8 - 7 - 6
</pre>
<pre class="sh">
  2 - 3 - 4 - 5
  1 - 8 - 7 - 6
</pre>


<h3>After the event</h3>

<p>
  Please complete your signing homework before
  <strong><%= conf.fetch(:homework_due).strftime(dateformat) %></strong>,
  and send your key signatures to the verified key owners,
  or upload them to a well-connected keyserver.
